At [[Ardsley High School]], Zuckerberg excelled in classes. After two years, he transferred to the private school [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], where he won prizes in mathematics, astronomy, physics, and classical studies. In his youth, he also attended the [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] [[Center for Talented Youth]] summer camp. On his college application, Zuckerberg stated that he could read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was captain of the fencing team.<ref name=Kirkpatrick>{{cite book |title=The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World |last=Kirkpatrick |first=David |year=2010 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4391-0211-4 |pages=20–21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRUkLhyGZVgC&pg=PA20#v=onepage|access-date=November 9, 2010}}</ref><ref name="whatwelearned">{{Cite news |first=Caitlin |last=McDevitt |title=What We Learned About Mark Zuckerberg This Week |date=March 5, 2010 |url=http://www.thebigmoney.com/blogs/facebook-status/2010/03/05/what-we-learned-about-mark-zuckerberg-week |work=The Big Money|access-date=March 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Grynbaum |first=Michael M. |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/6/10/mark-e-zuckerberg-06-the-whiz |title=Mark E.

==Software developer==
===Early years===
Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in [[middle school]]. His father taught him [[Atari]] [[BASIC Programming]] in the 1990s, and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him privately. Zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]] near his home while still in high school. In one program, since his father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called "ZuckNet" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a "primitive" version of [[AOL]]'s [[Instant messaging|Instant Messenger]], which came out the following year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.letsintern.com/blog/4-thing-mark-zuckerberg/ |title=4-thing-mark-zuckerberg | access-date=April 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://learni.st/users/jacobrwheeler/boards/83006-facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-child-prodigy |title=facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-child-prodigy | access-date=April 21, 2016}}</ref>

A ''New Yorker'' profile said of Zuckerberg: "some kids played computer games. Mark created them." Zuckerberg himself recalls this period: "I had a bunch of friends who were artists. They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it." The ''New Yorker'' piece noted that Zuckerberg was not, however, a typical "geek-klutz", as he later became captain of his prep school [[fencing]] team and earned a classics diploma. [[Napster]] co-founder [[Sean Parker]], a close friend, notes that Zuckerberg was "really into Greek odysseys and all that stuff", recalling how he once quoted lines from the Roman epic poem ''[[Aeneid]]'', by [[Virgil]], during a Facebook product conference.<ref name="NEWYORKER2010" />

During Zuckerberg's high school years, he worked under the company name Intelligent Media Group to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used [[machine learning]] to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to ''[[Slashdot]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://slashdot.org/articles/03/04/21/110236.shtml |title=Machine Learning and MP3s |author=Hemos/Dan Moore |date=April 21, 2003 |work=Slashdot|access-date=September 3, 2010}}</ref> and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from ''[[PC Magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1748374,00.asp |title=Synapse Media Player Review |first=Troy |last=Dreier |date=February 8, 2005 |work=PC Magazine |access-date=September 3, 2010}}</ref>

===College years===
[[File:MarkZuckerberg-crop.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Zuckerberg in 2005|alt=Mark Zuckerberg with a laptop, facing the camera]]
The ''New Yorker'' noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at [[Harvard]], he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy." He studied [[psychology]] and [[computer science]] and belonged to [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]] and [[Kirkland House]].<ref name = POTY /><ref name="NEWYORKER2010" /><ref>{{citation |title=Mark Zuckerberg speaks at BYU, calls Facebook "as much psychology and sociology as it is technology" |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700121651/Mark-Zuckerberg-speaks-at-BYU-calls-Facebook-as-much-psychology-and-sociology-as-it-is-technology.html|first=Chase |last=Larson |work=Deseret News |date=March 25, 2011|access-date=May 21, 2012}}</ref> In his [[sophomore]] year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called [[History of Facebook#Facemash|Facemash]] that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. According to Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, "he built the site for fun." Hasit explains:

<blockquote>We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.<ref name=Hasit>{{cite web |first=Guy|last=Grimland|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/facebook-founder-s-roommate-recounts-creation-of-internet-giant-1.275748 |title=Facebook founder's roommate recounts creation of Internet giant |work=Haaretz |date=October 5, 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's [[network switch]]es and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper."<ref name=Hasit />

The following semester, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website.<ref name="Hoffman, Claire">{{Cite magazine|first=Claire|last=Hoffman|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/|title=The Battle for Facebook|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=New York City|date=June 28, 2008|access-date=February 5, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703220456/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/|archivedate=July 3, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook," originally located at thefacebook.com.<ref name="skepticism">{{Cite news|access-date=April 30, 2008 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118539991204578084 |title=Judge Expresses Skepticism About Facebook Lawsuit |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]]|location=New York City|date=July 25, 2007 |author=Seward, Zachary M.}}</ref>

Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]], accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called [[ConnectU|HarvardConnection.com]], while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.<ref name="zuckerberghacked">{{Cite news |first=Nicolas |last=Carlson |title=In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg Broke Into A Facebook User's Private Email Account|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3 |magazine=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]]|location=New York City|date=March 5, 2010|access-date =March 5, 2010}}</ref> The three complained to ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', and the newspaper began an investigation in response.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

<blockquote>I remember really vividly, you know, having pizza with my friends a day or two after—I opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it.

With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.<ref name="rww051009" />

Once at college, Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a "Harvard thing" until Zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate [[Dustin Moskovitz]].

Zuckerberg, Moskovitz and some friends moved to [[Palo Alto, California]] in [[Silicon Valley]] where they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met [[Peter Thiel]], who invested in the company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard, but eventually decided to remain in California.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zuckerberg To Leave Harvard Indefinitely |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/11/1/zuckerberg-to-leave-harvard-indefinitely-mark/ |work=The Harvard Crimson |publisher=The Harvard Crimson, Inc|access-date=March 26, 2013 |first=Sam |last=Teller |date=November 1, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Business, Casual. |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/2/24/business-casual-a-year-ago-mark/ |work=The Harvard Crimson |publisher=The Harvard Crimson, Inc|access-date=March 26, 2013 |author=Kevin J.

In an interview in 2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: "It's not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] is just not an attractive idea to me."<ref name=Exeter />

He restated these goals to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine in 2010: "The thing I really care about is the mission, making the world open."<ref name="wired-zuckerberg" /> Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg sought the advice of former [[Netscape]] CFO [[Peter Currie (businessman)|Peter Currie]] about financing strategies for Facebook.<ref name=twsOctBPP>{{cite news |title=Yu, Zuckerberg and the Facebook fallout |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/2009/04/01/yu-zuckerberg-and-the-facebook-fallout/|access-date=March 26, 2013 |agency=Reuters |date=April 1, 2009 |first=Robert |last=MacMillan |quote=In a back-to-the-future move, former Netscape CFO Peter Currie will be the key adviser to Facebook about financial matters, until a new search for a CFO is found, sources said.}}</ref> On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark.<ref>{{citation |title=500 Million Stories |first=Mark |last=Zuckerberg |url=https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=409753352130 |publisher=The Facebook Blog |date=July 22, 2010|access-date=May 21, 2012}}</ref> When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained:

<blockquote>I guess we could&nbsp;... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average [[Search engine marketing|search]] query.

In 2010, [[Steven Levy]], who wrote the 1984 book ''[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]]'', wrote that Zuckerberg "clearly thinks of himself as a [[Hacker culture|hacker]]".

===Wirehog===
{{Main|Wirehog}}
A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, [[i2hub]], another campus-only service, created by [[Wayne Chang]], was launched. i2hub focused on [[peer-to-peer]] file sharing. At the time, both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August 2004, Zuckerberg, [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Adam D'Angelo]], and [[Sean Parker]] launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called [[Wirehog]], a precursor to [[Facebook Platform]] applications.<ref>{{Cite news |publisher=Martey Dodoo |url=http://www.marteydodoo.com/2004/08/16/wirehog/ |date=August 16, 2004 |title=Wirehog? |author=Martey Dodoo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |work=Harvard Crimson |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/8/13/zuckerberg-programs-new-website-having-seemingly/ |date=August 13, 2004 |title=Zuckerberg Programs New Website |author=Alan J.

On May 24, 2007, Zuckerberg announced [[Facebook Platform]], a development platform for programmers to create social applications within Facebook. Within weeks, many applications had been built and some already had millions of users. It grew to more than 800,000 developers around the world building applications for Facebook Platform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gits4u.com/infotech/info15.htm |title=80000 developers |access-date=April 21, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324022748/http://www.gits4u.com/infotech/info15.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2017 }}</ref>

On November 6, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Beacon, a social advertising system that enabled people to share information with their Facebook friends based on their browsing activities on other sites. For example, [[eBay]] sellers could let friends know automatically what they have for sale via the Facebook news feed as they listed items for sale. The program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and individual users. Zuckerberg and Facebook failed to respond to the concerns quickly, and on December 5, 2007, Zuckerberg wrote a blog post on Facebook,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=7584397130 |title=The Facebook Blog &#124; Facebook |publisher=Blog.facebook.com |access-date=June 26, 2010}}</ref> taking responsibility for the concerns about Beacon and offering an easier way for users to opt out of the service.

===Internet.org===
In a public Facebook post, Zuckerberg launched the [[Internet.org]] project in late August 2013. He explained that the primary aim of the initiative is to provide Internet access to the five billion people who are not connected as of the launch date. According to Zuckerberg, Internet.org would also create new jobs and open up new markets using a three-tier strategy. He stated in his post:

<blockquote>The world economy is going through a massive transition right now. The knowledge economy is the future. By bringing everyone online, we'll not only improve billions of lives, but we'll also improve our own as we benefit from the ideas and productivity they contribute to the world. Giving everyone the opportunity to connect is the foundation for enabling the knowledge economy. It is not the only thing we need to do, but it's a fundamental and necessary step.<ref name="Sew" /></blockquote>

Internet.org faced significant opposition in India, where activists said its limited internet ran counter to the idea of net neutrality; Zuckerberg said that a limited internet was better than no internet. Internet.org was shut down in India in February 2016.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jessi Hempel |url=https://www.wired.com/story/what-happened-to-facebooks-grand-plan-to-wire-the-world/ |title=What Happened to Internet.org, Facebook's Grand Plan to Wire the World? |work=wired.com |date=May 17, 2018 }}</ref> Zuckerberg later met with [[Narendra Modi]], [[Satya Nadella]] and [[Sundar Pichai]] in the San Francisco Bay Area to discuss how to effectively establish affordable [[internet]] access in less developed countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/at-facebook-we-also-believe-in-net-neutrality-very-strongly-mark-zuckerberg/ |title=Meet at the Silicon Valley among the tech leaders and Indian Prime Minister-Narendra Modi|access-date= October 9, 2015}}</ref> He also changed his Facebook profile picture to extend his support to [[Digital India]] to help rural communities stay connected to the internet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102393263811931&set=a.743613136151.2308566.4&type=3&permPage=1 |title=Mark Zuckerberg supports Digital India|access-date= October 9, 2015}}</ref>

In June 2010, Paul Ceglia, the owner of a wood [[pellet fuel]] company in [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County, upstate New York]], filed suit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84 percent ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages. According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that an initial fee of $1,000 entitled Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as an additional 1% interest in the business per day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was ''Facemash'', the predecessor of Facebook, but did not register the domain name ''thefacebook.com'' until January 1, 2004. Facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as "completely frivolous". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told a reporter that Ceglia's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellsvilledaily.com/article/20100729/NEWS/307299940 |title=Facebook does not have a like button for Ceglia |author=Anderson, John |publisher=WellsvilleDaily.com |date=July 29, 2010|access-date=August 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/07/20/zuckerberg-ceglia |title=Venture beat coverage of Ceglia lawsuit|date=July 20, 2010}}</ref>

On October 26, 2012, federal authorities arrested Ceglia, charging him with mail and wire fraud and of "tampering with, destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the Facebook founder of billions of dollars." Ceglia is accused of fabricating emails to make it appear that he and Zuckerberg discussed details about an early version of Facebook, although after examining their emails, investigators found there was no mention of Facebook in them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/Feds-Collar-Would-Be-Facebook-Fraudster-76504.html |title=Feds Collar Would-Be Facebook Fraudster |publisher=E-Commerce News |date=October 29, 2012}}</ref> Some law firms withdrew from the case before it was initiated and others after Ceglia's arrest.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/a-dubious-case-found-lawyers-eager-to-make-some-money/ |title=A Dubious Case Found Lawyers Eager to Make Some Money |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_21887915/paul-ceglias-lawyer-drops-out-facebook-suit-after |title=Paul Ceglia's lawyer drops out of Facebook suit after arrest |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |date=October 30, 2012}}</ref>

He added, "Mark has been so gracious about something that's really so uncomfortable&nbsp;... The fact that he would do ''SNL'' and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous.

====Disputed accuracy====
Jeff Jarvis, author of the book ''Public Parts'', interviewed Zuckerberg and believed Sorkin made up too much of the story. He stated, "That's what the internet is accused of doing, making stuff up, not caring about the facts."<ref name=BBCmovie>Rohrer, Finlo. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11437873 "Is the Facebook movie the truth about Mark Zuckerberg"] BBC, September 30, 2010</ref>

According to David Kirkpatrick, former technology editor at ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine and author of ''The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World,'' (2011),<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1439102120 "The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World"], release date February 1, 2011</ref> "the film is only "40% true&nbsp;... he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way, the way Zuckerberg is played in the movie." He says that "a lot of the factual incidents are accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false", and concludes that primarily "his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the Internet".<ref name=BBCmovie />

Although the film portrayed Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite [[Officially unrecognized Harvard College social clubs|final clubs]] at Harvard, Zuckerberg said he had no interest in joining the clubs.<ref name="NEWYORKER2010" /> Kirkpatrick agreed that the impression implied by the film is "false". Karel Baloun, a former senior engineer at Facebook, noted that the "image of Zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated&nbsp;... It is fiction&nbsp;..." He likewise dismissed the film's assertion that he "would deliberately betray a friend."<ref name=BBCmovie />

On February 24, 2016, Zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten "[[Black Lives Matter]]" phrases on the company walls and had written "All Lives Matter" in their place. Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. The memo was then leaked by several employees. As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but "malicious as well." According to Zuckerberg's memo, "''Black Lives Matter'' doesn't mean other lives don't – it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve." The memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself, "means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's."
