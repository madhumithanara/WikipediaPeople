'''Kobe Bean Bryant''' ({{IPAc-en|'|k|oʊ|b|iː}} {{respell|KOH|bee}}; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American professional [[basketball]] player.

Bryant also [[List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders|led the NBA in scoring]] twice, and ranks fourth on the league's [[List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders|all-time regular season scoring]] and [[List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders|all-time postseason scoring]] lists.

Born in [[Philadelphia]] and partly raised in [[Italy]], Bryant was recognized as the top high-school basketball player in the U.S. while at [[Lower Merion High School]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. The son of former NBA player [[Joe Bryant]], he declared for the [[1996 NBA draft]] after graduation, and was selected by the [[1996–97 Charlotte Hornets season|Charlotte Hornets]] with the 13th overall pick; the Hornets then traded him to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 [[Slam Dunk Contest]], and he was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a [[Shaq–Kobe feud|feud]] with teammate [[Shaquille O'Neal]], the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from [[2000 NBA Finals|2000]] to [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]]. In 2003, Bryant was [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case|accused of sexual assault]],<ref>{{Cite news|last=Draper|first=Kevin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/sports/basketball/kobe-bryant-rape-case.html|title=Kobe Bryant and the Sexual Assault Case That Was Dropped but Not Forgotten|date=2020-01-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-14|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> with criminal charges eventually being dropped after the accuser refused to testify, with a lawsuit later settled out of court. Bryant denied the assault charge, but admitted to a sexual encounter and issued a public apology.

After the Lakers lost the [[2004 NBA Finals]], O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the cornerstone of the Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring during the [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06]] and [[2006–07 NBA season|2006–07]] seasons. In 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points; the second [[List of National Basketball Association single-game scoring leaders|most points scored in a single game]] in league history, behind [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game]] in 1962. Bryant led the team to two consecutive championships in [[2009 NBA Finals|2009]] and [[2010 NBA Finals|2010]], and was named NBA Finals MVP on both occasions. He continued to be among the top players in the league through 2013, when he suffered a [[torn Achilles tendon]] at age 34. He subsequently suffered season-ending injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively, in the following two seasons. Citing physical decline, Bryant retired after the [[2015–16 NBA season|2015–16 season]].

Bryant is the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history. He was also the first [[Guard (basketball)|guard]] in NBA history to play at least [[List of National Basketball Association seasons played leaders|20 seasons]]. His 18 All-Star designations are the [[List of NBA All-Stars|second most all time]], while it is the record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP Awards]] are tied with [[Bob Pettit]] for the most in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname "'''Black Mamba'''" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. At the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]] and [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]], he won two [[gold medal]]s as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national team]]. In 2018, he won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] for his 2017 film ''[[Dear Basketball]]''.<ref name="Oscar" />

Bryant died at age 41, along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others, due to [[blunt force trauma]] sustained from a [[2020 Calabasas helicopter crash|helicopter crash]] in [[Calabasas, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52687408|title= Kobe Bryant helicopter crash post-mortem released|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date= May 16, 2020|accessdate=May 16, 2020}}</ref>

==Professional career==

===1996 NBA draft===
Before the [[1996 NBA draft]], Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged against former Lakers players [[Larry Drew]] and [[Michael Cooper]] and, according to then-Laker manager [[Jerry West]], "marched over these people".<ref>{{cite news |title=Deals Are What Made The Lakers |url= |work=Long Beach Press-Telegram |date=February 25, 2000}}</ref>

The Lakers were looking to trade their starting [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Vlade Divac]] for a player's draft rights to free up [[NBA salary cap|salary cap]] space to make an offer to free-agent center [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. Bill Branch, the [[Charlotte Hornets]]' head scout at the time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their No. 13 pick to the Lakers the day before the draft. Before the trade agreement, the Hornets never considered drafting Bryant. During the draft, the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select minutes before the pick was made.<ref>{{cite web |last=Delong|first=John|url=http://www2.journalnow.com/content/2008/jun/18/lakers-trade-for-bryant-has-been-misconstrued/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20081015202520/http://www2.journalnow.com/content/2008/jun/18/lakers-trade-for-bryant-has-been-misconstrued/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 15, 2008 |title=Lakers' trade for Bryant has been misconstrued |newspaper=Winston-Salem Journal |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref> Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high school. After the draft, the trade was put in jeopardy when Divac threatened to retire rather than be traded from Los Angeles.

The Lakers advanced to the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] semifinals in the [[1997 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] against the [[1996–97 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]], when Bryant was pressed into a lead role at the end of Game 5.

In Game 4 against the Kings, Bryant recorded 48 points, 16 rebounds and 3 assists in a 119–113 series-clinching win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200105130SAC.html|title=Los Angeles Lakers at Sacramento Kings Box Score, May 13, 2001|publisher=Basketball-Reference|accessdate=October 28, 2019}}</ref> They swept the [[2000–01 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]] in the Conference Finals to advance to the [[2001 NBA Finals|Finals]], before losing their first game against the [[2000–01 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]] in overtime. They would go on to win the next four games and bring their second championship to Los Angeles in as many seasons. During the playoffs, Bryant played heavy minutes which brought his stats up to 29.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game. In the playoffs, teammate O'Neal declared Bryant the best player in the league.<ref name="HighSchool" /> Bryant ended up making the All-NBA Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the second year in a row. In addition, he was also voted to start in the NBA All-Star Game for the third year in a row (no game in 1999).

In the [[2001–02 NBA season|2001–02 season]], Bryant played 80 games for the first time in his career. On January 14, 2002, Bryant recorded a then career-high 56 points to go along with five rebounds and four assists in a 120–81 win over the visiting [[2001–02 Memphis Grizzlies season|Memphis Grizzlies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200201140LAL.html|title=Memphis Grizzlies at Los Angeles Lakers Box Score, January 14, 2002|publisher=Basketball-Reference|accessdate=October 28, 2019}}</ref> He continued his all-round play by averaging 25.2 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. Bryant also had a career-high 46.9% shooting and once again led his team in assists. He claimed his first [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP trophy]] after a 31-point performance in Philadelphia when he was loudly booed by fans as they had throughout the game, stemming from his earlier comment to a 76ers heckler during the Finals that the Lakers were "going to cut your hearts out".<ref>{{cite news |title=Lou Williams-led 76ers spoil Kobe Bryant's milestone night |url=https://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=320206020|website=[[ESPN]] |date=February 6, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dRrvozDV?url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=320206020 |archivedate=December 1, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=smallwood_02062012>{{cite news |last=Smallwood |first=John |title=Love him or not, Kobe Bryant a Philly player |date=February 6, 2012 |website=Philly.com |url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-02-06/sports/31030484_1_philadelphia-and-bryant-nba-mvp-gregg-downer |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dRs8t3cd?url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-02-06/sports/31030484_1_philadelphia-and-bryant-nba-mvp-gregg-downer |archivedate=December 1, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> While making the All-NBA Defensive Team again, Bryant was also named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career.

The road to the Finals would prove a lot tougher than the record run the Lakers had enjoyed the previous year. While the Lakers swept the [[2001–02 Portland Trail Blazers season|Blazers]] and defeated the [[2001–02 San Antonio Spurs season|Spurs]] 4–1 in the first two rounds of the [[2002 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], the Lakers did not have home-court advantage against the [[2001–02 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]]. The series would stretch to seven games, the first time this had happened to the Lakers since the 2000 Western Conference Finals. However, the Lakers were able to beat their division rivals and make their third consecutive NBA Finals appearance. In the [[2002 NBA Finals|2002 Finals]], against the [[2001–02 New Jersey Nets season|New Jersey Nets]], Bryant averaged 26.8 points, 51.4% shooting, 5.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists per game, which included scoring a quarter of the team's points.<ref name="Finals">{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/02playoffs/2002-06-14-kobe.htm | work=[[USA Today]] | title=Bryant's heroics, deference pay off for Lakers | date=June 14, 2002 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> At age 23, Bryant became the youngest player to win three championships.<ref name="Finals" /> Bryant's play was notable and praised for his performance in the fourth quarter of games, specifically the last two rounds of the playoffs.<ref name="Finals" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/games/20020512/LALSAS/recap.html |title=PLAYOFFS 2002 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=June 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809235342/http://www.nba.com/games/20020512/LALSAS/recap.html |archive-date=August 9, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> This cemented Bryant's reputation as a "clutch player".

Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the [[2004–05 Los Angeles Lakers season|2004–05 season]] with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year. A particularly damaging salvo came when Jackson wrote ''[[The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul]]''. The book detailed the events of the Lakers' tumultuous [[2003–04 NBA season|2003–04 season]] and has several criticisms of Bryant. In the book, Jackson called Bryant "un-coachable".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/06/sports/basketball/06lakers.html |title=Coach and Star Savor Success in Collaboration |date=May 6, 2006 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 5, 2008 | first=Howard | last=Beck}}</ref> Midway through the season, Tomjanovich suddenly resigned as Lakers coach, citing the recurrence of health problems and exhaustion.<ref>Associated Press.

====Sexual assault case====
{{Main|Kobe Bryant sexual assault case}}
In the summer of 2003, the sheriff's office of [[Eagle, Colorado]], arrested Bryant in connection with an investigation of a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee. Bryant had checked into The Lodge and Spa at Cordillera in Eagle County in advance of undergoing knee surgery nearby. The accuser stated that Bryant raped her in his hotel room the night before Bryant was to have the procedure. Bryant admitted to an [[adulterous]] sexual encounter with his accuser but denied her sexual assault allegation.<ref>{{cite news|last=SI Staff |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/basketball/nba/12/26/kobe.interview.ap/index.html?cnn-yes |date=December 23, 2003 |title=Bryant distracted, scared amid sex assault case |agency=Associated Press |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040906074827/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/basketball/nba/12/26/kobe.interview.ap/index.html?cnn-yes |archivedate=September 6, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/lakers/2004-02-12-shaq-kobe_x.htm |title=Shaq, Kobe still main keys to Lakers' fortunes |first=David Leon |last=Moore |date=February 12, 2004 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=February 25, 2007}}</ref>

Sony pushed Bryant from his roots of [[underground hip hop]] into a more radio-friendly sound. His debut album, ''Visions'', was scheduled to release in the spring of 2000. The first single, "K.O.B.E'", featured supermodel [[Tyra Banks]] singing the [[Hook (music)|hook]]. The single debuted in January 2000, and was performed at NBA All-Star Weekend that month; the song was not well received.

Ahead of the match, the Lakers paid tribute to Bryant and all who lost their lives in the crash with a ceremony held just before tip off, with [[Usher (musician)|Usher]] singing "[[Amazing Grace]]" and [[Boyz II Men]] singing the National Anthem, while [[Wiz Khalifa]] and [[Charlie Puth]] reunited to perform "[[See You Again]]" – originally their tribute to [[Paul Walker]] after his death while filming ''[[Furious 7]]'' – at halftime. James also delivered a speech to the crowd before the game, and every player in the Lakers starting lineup was announced with Bryant's name.<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://mirrorherald.com/kobe-bryant-memorial-lakers-nation-sinks-in-an-emotional-arena/|title= Kobe Bryant Memorial:Lakers Nation Sinks in an Emotional Arena|accessdate=February 1, 2020|website=Mirror Herald}}</ref> The game was the second-most-watched in ESPN history, averaging 4.41 million viewers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kobe Bryant Tribute Game 2nd Most Watched in ESPN NBA History|date=February 3, 2020|website=NBCLosAngeles.com|url=https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/sports/kobe-bryant-tribute-game-2nd-most-watched-in-espn-nba-history/2303341/|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>

Also, beginning with the Spurs and the Raptors in their game in San Antonio on the day of the crash, teams paid tribute to Bryant at the start of their games with intentional on-court violations referring to his uniform numbers on their first possession – either a 24-second [[shot clock]] or an [[8-second backcourt violation]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kobe-bryant-death-nba-teams-honor-lakers-legend-with-24-second-8-second-violations-to-start-games/ |title=Kobe Bryant death: NBA teams honor Lakers legend with 24-second, 8-second violations to start games |website=CBSSports.com |access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref> On February 15, NBA commissioner [[Adam Silver]] announced that the All-Star Game MVP Award would be renamed to the [[NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant Most Valuable Player]] in Bryant's honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28710867/nba-all-star-game-mvp-award-named-honor-kobe-bryant|title=NBA All-Star Game MVP award named for Kobe|date=February 16, 2020|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>

Elsewhere, the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]] went ahead as scheduled at the Staples Center on the day of the crash, but included tributes by multiple artists and groups, including host [[Alicia Keys]] opening the show with a tribute speech and joining Boyz II Men to sing "[[It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday]]".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Whitten |first1=Sarah |title='Heartbroken in the house that Kobe Bryant built': Lakers legend remembered at Grammys |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/26/grammys-2020-kobe-bryant-remembered-at-grammy-performers.html |publisher=CNBC |accessdate=January 27, 2020  |date=January 27, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Vanderhoof |first1=Erin |title=Grammys 2020: Lil Nas X, DJ Khaled, the Jonas Brothers, and More Pay Tribute to Kobe Bryant |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/01/grammy-awards-tribute-to-kobe-bryant |website=Vanity Fair |accessdate=January 27, 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/27/2020-grammys-billie-eilish-recording-academy |title =Grammys 2020: Billie Eilish's triumph overshadowed but well-deserved|date=January 27, 2020|work=The Guardian|accessdate=January 27, 2020}}</ref> In May, the Mamba Sports Academy was renamed to Sports Academy out of respect for Bryant.<ref name=spears_05122020/>
