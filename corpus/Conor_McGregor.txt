The fight began with McGregor shifting stances frequently, before looking to establish his signature left cross. After a McGregor combination in the first round, Diaz returned fire with two consecutive hooks, one a slap, a signature of Nate and his brother, [[Nick Diaz]], termed the "Stockton Slap". McGregor avoided Diaz's jabs by slipping to his right, often before throwing his left overhand. The second round commenced with Diaz using his check right hook, attempting to keep the aggressive McGregor at distance. McGregor had success with his bodywork, but Diaz began to land combinations of his own. After a stiff one-two from Diaz, McGregor seemed fatigued and troubled by the shots. He attempted a [[takedown (grappling)#Double leg takedown|double leg takedown]], which Diaz successfully defended by [[sprawl (grappling)|sprawling]]. Diaz then threatened the [[guillotine choke]], which forced McGregor onto his back after stopping McGregor from scrambling out of the position as he had during the bout with [[Chad Mendes]] at [[UFC 189]]. Diaz secured the [[mount (grappling)|mount]], before firing off a volley of strikes from the top. In an effort to avoid the assault, McGregor gave up his back, and Diaz secured a [[rear naked choke]]. McGregor tapped to the submission at 4:12 into the second round, causing referee [[Herb Dean]] to intervene and stop the bout.<ref name="SherdogArticle">{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/UFC-196-Results-McGregor-vs-Diaz-PlaybyPlay-Updates-101235#conor-mcgregor-nate-diaz|title=UFC 196 Results: 'McGregor vs. Diaz' Play-by-Play & Updates |last1=Breen |first1=Jordan |last2=Critchfield |first2=Tristen |last3=Nelson |first3=Chris |date=5 March 2016 |website=Sherdog}}</ref><ref name="MetricMvD">{{cite web|url=http://www.fightmetric.com/fight-details/4ace70bff9debdfb |title=UFC 196: McGregor vs Diaz |website=FightMetric}}</ref><ref name="JackSlack">{{cite web|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/death-of-a-southpaw-how-conor-mcgregor-lost-to-nate-diaz|title=Death of a Southpaw: How Conor McGregor Lost to Nate Diaz |last=Slack |first=Jack |date=7 March 2016 |website=Fightland}}</ref> Both competitors were awarded "Fight of the Night" bonuses, and McGregor received the highest disclosed purse of any fighter in the history of the company to that point, at $1,000,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2016/03/ufc-196-results-nate-diaz-shocks-conor-mcgregor-with-second-round-choke |title=UFC 196 results: Nate Diaz shocks Conor McGregor with second-round choke |website=MMAjunkie.com |first=Steven |last=Marrocco |date=6 March 2016 |accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/blogs/mma/mcgregor-gets-a-record-1m-purse-at-ufc-196/|title=McGregor gets a record $1M purse at UFC 196|work=Sportsnet.ca}}</ref> McGregor was critical of his own performance while praising Diaz, saying "I was inefficient with my energy.

==Mixed martial arts fighting style==
McGregor is known mostly as a [[Strike (attack)|striker]] and prefers to fight standing up, as opposed to on the ground. McGregor is left handed and primarily fights out of the [[southpaw stance]], but often switches to an orthodox stance. He will frequently try to be the aggressor in his bouts.<ref name=ufcprofile/> McGregor's [[boxing]] is typically considered his best skill, with the majority of his victories coming by way of knockout or technical-knockout via punches.<ref name=SutcliffeOnMcGregor/> Many pundits cite McGregor's pull-back left-handed counter as his most dangerous strike.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/the-secret-behind-conor-mcgregors-striking-skills/ |title=The Tactical Guide to Conor McGregor Verses Eddie Alvarez |date=7 November 2016 |website=Boxing News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/how-conor-mcgregor-killed-another-king |title=How Conor McGregor Killed Another King |date=14 November 2016 |website=Fightland}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/8/16/4623842/judo-chop-striking-conor-mcgregor-ufc-mma-fight-night-shogun-sonnen-26-technique-gif-ko|title=Judo Chop: The Striking of Conor McGregor |date=16 August 2013 |website=Bloody Elbow}}</ref>

McGregor will almost always engage in [[trash talk]] and "[[psychological warfare]]" against his opponents, which has led to comparisons with [[Muhammad Ali]], whom McGregor cites as one of his early inspirations.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PBUo6wiowQ|title=Conor McGregor on Jordan, Ali and Benjamin Franklin|date=16 January 2015|publisher=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/ufc/12044082/UFC-194-Conor-McGregor-says-movement-will-make-Jose-Aldo-fall-into-dead-space-like-a-zombie.html|title=UFC 194: Conor McGregor says movement will make Jose Aldo 'fall into dead space like a zombie'|date=10 December 2015|first=Gareth A.|last=Davies|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/1/13/7539497/conor-mcgregor-doesnt-want-to-be-muhammad-ali-mma-news|title=Conor McGregor doesn't want to be compared to 'special' Muhammad Ali|first=Marc|last=Raimondi|date=14 January 2015|publisher=MMA Fighting}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=13 December 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/dec/13/conor-mcgregor-is-the-rarest-of-athletes-one-who-delivers-on-his-boasts|title=Conor McGregor is the rarest of athletes: one who delivers on his boasts|first=Les|last=Carpenter|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> After Ali died in June 2016, McGregor opined that "nobody will ever come close to [Ali's] greatness".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BGOyjTfrzjK/|title=Instagram photo by Conor McGregor Official|date=4 June 2016|publisher=Instagram}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TheNotoriousMMA/status/739058134912794628|title=Tweet by Conor McGregor|publisher=Twitter|date=4 June 2016}}</ref> McGregor has also cited [[Bruce Lee]] as an inspiration,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Belden |first1=Sam |title=Conor McGregor is adhering to a Bruce Lee philosophy to convert to boxing and prepare for Floyd Mayweather |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/conor-mcgregor-bruce-lee-philosophy-boxing-2017-8 |accessdate=30 August 2019 |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=17 August 2017}}</ref> and compared himself to Lee.<ref>{{cite news |title=Conor McGregor Considers Himself As The Modern 'Bruce Lee' |url=https://ritely.com/mcgregor-as-modern-lee/ |accessdate=30 August 2019 |work=Ritely |date=10 August 2018}}</ref>

==Professional boxing career==
===Background===
When McGregor was 12 years old, he began [[boxing]] at Crumlin Boxing Club under two-time Olympian [[Philip Sutcliffe, Snr.|Phil Sutcliffe]].<ref name=SutcliffeOnMcGregor/> It was here where he laid the foundations to his striking ability,<ref name=fundamentals/> training with fighters such as [[Dean Byrne (boxer)|Dean Byrne]] and [[Jamie Kavanagh]], both of whom went on to train at Wild Card Gym under [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddie Roach]]. Kavanagh recalls McGregor as "a game kind of boxer. He was very game. He loved to fight. But he was also very strong – he could seriously bang."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balls.ie/mma/jamie-kavanagh-explains-what-conor-mcgregor-was-like-as-a-boxer-back-in-crumlin/326550|title=Jamie Kavanagh Explains What Conor McGregor Was Like As A Boxer Back In Crumlin |website=Balls.ie |date=5 March 2016 |first=Gavan |last=Casey}}</ref> Early boxing inspirations for McGregor included American boxers [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Roy Jones]] as well as British boxers [[Naseem Hamed|"Prince" Naseem Hamed]] and [[Chris Eubank]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Conor McGregor reveals his favourite boxers ahead of ring debut |url=https://www.joe.co.uk/sport/conor-mcgregor-reveals-his-favourite-boxers-ahead-of-ring-debut-137765 |accessdate=9 October 2018 |website=[[Joe (website)|JOE]] |date=7 August 2017}}</ref>

McGregor would eventually become an All-Ireland champion at youth level,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://severemma.com/2014/07/father-and-son-tony-mcgregor-on-his-sons-meteoric-rise/|title=Father and Son: Tony McGregor on his son's meteoric rise}}</ref> but his attention began to turn towards other martial arts when he was about sixteen.<ref name="SutcliffeOnMcGregor"/> Despite this, and his family moving to West Dublin, McGregor continued boxing. He has regularly sparred at Celtic Warrior Gym, [[Blanchardstown]], which has been home to boxers such as [[Gary O'Sullivan]] and [[Frank Buglioni]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/other-sports/spike-sharper-with-new-training-regime-291588.html|title=Spike sharper with new training regime}}</ref> Head coach Packie Collins, brother of [[Steve Collins|Steve]], commented "he comes down here and he can hold his own with world champions." He continued "I won't name names but, the last time he was up here a very good boxer of ours couldn't make head nor tail of what Conor was doing. He has what appears like a kind of chopping movement when he strikes and he doesn't use a traditional stance, so this guy just couldn't time him at all."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://severemma.com/2013/08/paschal-collins-conor-will-be-a-phenomenon-in-boston/|title=Paschal Collins: Conor will be a phenomenon in Boston}}</ref>

===Fight against Floyd Mayweather Jr.===
{{Main|Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor}}
On 14 June 2017, it was announced that McGregor would compete in his first professional boxing match against the undefeated [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], [[Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor|on 26 August 2017]] at [[T-Mobile Arena]] in [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]], [[Nevada]]. The bout was contested at [[Light middleweight|super welterweight]] (154 pounds) with 8 oz. gloves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-fight-finalized-aug-26-205101486.html |title=Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor fight finalized for Aug. 26 |website =Yahoo!

On 24 August 2017, it was announced that Mayweather and McGregor would compete for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Money Belt.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing/mayweather-mcgregor/mayweather-vs-mcgregor-money-belt-fight-wbc-new-floyd-conor-boxer-ufc-a7910761.html|title=Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor to fight for new 'Money' belt created by WBC |newspaper=The Independent |first=Evan |last=Bartlett |date=24 August 2017 |accessdate=31 March 2019}}</ref> According to the [[Nevada Athletic Commission|Nevada State Athletic Commission]], Mayweather would earn a guaranteed purse of $100 million and McGregor was guaranteed $30 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/mayweather-mcgregor-huge-guarantees-ppv-clash--119839 |title=Mayweather, McGregor Have Huge Guarantees For PPV Clash |website=BoxingScene.com |first=Jamie |last=Micklethwaite |date=26 August 2017 |accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref>

In front of 14,623, far short of a sell-out, Mayweather won via TKO in the 10th round. In the opening round, Mayweather started slowly. After the fight, he revealed it was part of the game plan to let McGregor punch himself out in the early rounds. McGregor won the first round on all three judges' scorecards; the same case could have been made for the opening three rounds. By the fourth round, Mayweather started to take control and landed with his right hands. For the next few rounds, Mayweather continued to land clean punches and win the rounds. In round 9, McGregor, although he did not look hurt, was visibly fatigued. Two of the judges scored the round 10–8 to Mayweather. In round 10, Mayweather landed some hard shots that staggered McGregor across the ring and had him heavily slopped against the ropes. After a few unanswered punches, the referee waved the fight off. The time of stoppage was 1 minute and 5 seconds of round 10.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/floyd-mayweather-stops-conor-mcgregor-10th-round--119882|title=Floyd Mayweather Stops Conor McGregor in 10th Round – Boxing News|publisher=BoxingScene.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref>

At the time of stoppage, the scorecards read 87–83, 89–82, and 89–81, all in favour of Mayweather. McGregor was praised by Dana White in the post-fight press conference for landing 111 punches of 430 thrown (26%) on Mayweather, which was more than [[Manny Pacquiao]] landed in [[Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao|his fight against Mayweather]] billed as ''The Fight of the Century'', and more than any of Mayweather's previous nine opponents. Mayweather was far more accurate however, landing 170 of 320 punches thrown (53%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/20471276/floyd-mayweather-defeats-conor-mcgregor-tko-10th-round |title=Mayweather stops fading McGregor in Round 10 |website=ESPN |first=Dan |last=Rafael |date=27 August 2017 |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref>

Nevada State Athletic Commission announced the live gate for the event was $55,414,865.79 from 13,094 tickets sold. This was less than the [[Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao|Mayweather vs. Pacquiao]] fight, which grossed $72 million from a paid attendance of 16,219 in 2015, despite claims from Ellerbe and Mayweather that it did more than $80 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmaweekly.com/floyd-mayweather-vs-conor-mcgregor-live-gate-falls-well-short-of-all-time-record |title=Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor Live Gate Falls Well Short of All-Time Record |website=MMA Weekly |first=Damon |last=Martin |date=6 September 2017 |accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref> [[Sky Sports]] announced the fight garnered over a million PPV buys in the UK and grossed in excess of £20 million, surpassing the record set in April 2017 when [[Anthony Joshua vs. Wladimir Klitschko|Anthony Joshua defeated Wladimir Klitschko]] in front of 90,000 at [[Wembley Stadium]].

===Bus attack at UFC 223 Media Day===
On 3 April 2018, [[Khabib Nurmagomedov]] and [[Artem Lobov]] had a minor altercation, in which Nurmagomedov cornered Lobov. Lobov is known to be close to McGregor, with whom Nurmagomedov has had altercations and [[trash talk]] exchanges.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2018/4/4/17197026/ufc-223-video-watch-mma-news-khabib-nurmagomedov-artem-lobov-hotel-confrontation|title=Video: Khabib Nurmagomedov and Artem Lobov in altercation in Brooklyn hotel|publisher=Bloody Elbow|first=Lewis|last=McKeever|date=4 April 2018}}</ref> The two groups have a lengthy history of insults and confrontations.

On 5 April 2018, during promotional appearances for [[UFC 223]], McGregor and a group of about twenty others were let into the [[Barclays Center]] by credentialed members of his promotional team. They attempted to confront Nurmagomedov, who was on a bus leaving the arena with "red corner" fighters for UFC 223 on it, such as [[Rose Namajunas]], [[Al Iaquinta]], [[Karolina Kowalkiewicz]], [[Ray Borg]], and [[Michael Chiesa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2018/04/dana-white-artem-lobov-ufc-223-alex-caceres-canceled-conor-mcgregor-melee-mma-new-york-michael-chiesa|title=Khabib Nurmagomedov reacts to Conor McGregor's bus attack: 'I am laughing'|date=5 April 2018 |website=MMAjunkie.com |first=Ariel |last=Helwani |accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> McGregor ran up alongside the slowly moving bus and then ran past it to grab a metal equipment [[Hand truck|dolly]], which he then threw at the bus's window, before trying to throw other objects in the vicinity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/4/5/17203890/watch-conor-mcgregor-throw-a-dolly-through-ufc-223-fighter-bus-window |title=Watch Conor McGregor throw a dolly through UFC 223 fighter bus window |publisher=MMA Fighting |first=Shaun |last=Al-Shatti |date=5 April 2018}}</ref> Chiesa and Borg were injured by the shattered glass and sent to hospital.

===Incident at UFC 229===
Following the fight at UFC 229 on 6 October 2018, Khabib Nurmagomedov jumped out of the cage and charged towards McGregor's training partner Dillon Danis. Soon afterwards, McGregor and [[Abubakar Nurmagomedov]], Khabib's cousin, also attempted to exit the octagon, but a scuffle broke out after McGregor punched Abubakar, who then punched him back.<ref>{{cite web |title=Khabib's cousin Abubakar Nurmagomedov shows damage inflicted on him by Conor McGregor |url=https://www.joe.co.uk/sport/khabib-nurmagomedov-cousin-conor-mcgregor-punch-203121 |website=[[Joe (website)|JOE]] |first=Patrick |last=McCarry |date=7 October 2018 |accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref> Two of Nurmagomedov's cornermen retaliated: Esed Emiragaev and [[Zubaira Tukhugov]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Васильев |first1=Руслан |title=На Макгрегора напали после боя.

Nurmagomedov's payment for the fight was withheld by the [[Nevada State Athletic Commission]] (NSAC) as a result, pending an investigation into his actions. Nurmagomedov appeared at the post-fight interview and apologised to the NSAC, while also saying that, "You cannot talk about religion. You cannot talk about nation.
