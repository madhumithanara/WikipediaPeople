Born in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], Reeves grew up in [[Toronto]]. He began acting in theatre productions, and in television films before making his mainstream film debut in ''[[Youngblood (1986 film)|Youngblood]]'' (1986). Reeves gained recognition in his breakthrough role as Ted "Theodore" Logan in the [[science fiction]] comedy ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'' (1989). This was followed by a supporting role in [[Ron Howard]]'s comedy ''[[Parenthood (film)|Parenthood]]'', 1991's ''[[Point Break]]'', a sequel, ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]'', and the independent drama ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' where playing a street [[Hustling|hustler]] received critical praise for his performance. He had a supporting role in ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992), which was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]].

The action thriller ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' (1994), in which Reeves was cast as a police officer, garnered critical and commercial success, and helped Reeves gain further recognition. He followed this with a series of films [[box office]] failures, including: ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' (1995), ''[[Chain Reaction (1996 film)|Chain Reaction]]'' (1996), and ''[[The Last Time I Committed Suicide]]'' (1997). However, his performance in the supernatural horror ''[[The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'' (1997) was well received. Global stardom followed soon after with his lead role as computer hacker [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] in the science fiction thriller ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999). The film was a commercial success and won four Academy Awards, although its sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded|Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions|Revolutions]]'' (both in 2003) were met with a mixed reception. In 2005, Reeves played [[exorcist]] [[John Constantine]] in ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'' and a dentist in the comedy-drama ''[[Thumbsucker (film)|Thumbsucker]]''. He also starred in the [[animation|animated]] film ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (2006), the romantic drama ''[[The Lake House (film)|The Lake House]]'' (2006), the science fiction thriller ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (2008), and the crime thriller ''[[Street Kings]]'' (2008).

In 2013, he made his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with ''[[Man of Tai Chi]]''. Although he was praised for his direction, the film was a [[box-office bomb]]. In 2014, Reeves played the [[Title character|titular]] assassin in the [[neo-noir]] action thriller ''[[John Wick (film)|John Wick]]'', which was a commercial success and was generally well-received. He also narrated two documentaries in 2015; ''[[Deep Web (film)|Deep Web]] and'' ''[[Mifune: The Last Samurai]]''. 2016 saw Reeves star in five films, including ''[[The Neon Demon]], [[The Bad Batch]]'', and ''[[The Whole Truth (2016 film)|The Whole Truth]]''.

In 2019, Reeves voiced Duke Caboom in ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' (2019). Reeves has spent most of his career [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as the [[action hero]]; "saving the world" is a recurring [[character arc]] in many roles he has portrayed, such as the characters of Ted "Theodore" Logan, [[Little Buddha|Gautama Buddha]], Neo, Johnny Mnemonic, [[John Constantine#Film|John Constantine]], and [[Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Klaatu]].

===2014–present: Resurgence and ''John Wick''===

After this series of commercial failures, Reeves career rebounded in 2014. He played the titular role in the action thriller ''[[John Wick (film)|John Wick]]'', directed by [[Chad Stahelski]].

In 2010, an image of Reeves became an [[internet meme]] after photographs of him were published, sitting on a park bench with a sad facial expression.
