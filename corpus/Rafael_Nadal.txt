== Early life ==
Rafael Nadal was born in [[Manacor]], a town on the island of [[Mallorca]] in the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Spain]], to parents Ana María Parera Femenías and Sebastián Nadal Homar. His father is a businessman, owner of an insurance company, glass and window company Vidres Mallorca, and the restaurant, Sa Punta. Rafael has a younger sister, María Isabel. His uncle, [[Miguel Ángel Nadal]], is a retired professional [[association football|footballer]], who played for [[RCD Mallorca]], [[FC Barcelona]], and the [[Spain national football team|Spanish national team]].<ref name="times">{{cite news | first=Christopher | last=Clarey | title=Rafael Nadal, Barely 19, He's Got Game, Looks and Remarkably Good Manners | date=6 June 2005 | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/06/sports/tennis/06nadal.html|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> He idolized Barcelona striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] as a child, and via his uncle got access to the Barcelona dressing room to have a photo with the Brazilian.<ref>{{cite news |title=Planet football hails O Fenômeno |url=https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2011/m=2/news=planet-football-hails-fenomeno-1388593.html |accessdate=3 October 2018 |agency=FIFA.com}}</ref>  Recognizing in Rafael a natural talent, another uncle, [[Toni Nadal]], a tennis coach, introduced him to the game when he was three years old.<ref name="Rajaraman">{{cite web|url=http://www.insidetennis.com/archive/0608_french_open_nadal.html|first=Aarthi|last=Rajaraman|title=At Home with Humble yet Ambitious Nadal|date=1 June 2008|work=Inside Tennis|accessdate=5 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609141023/http://www.insidetennis.com/archive/0608_french_open_nadal.html|archivedate=9 June 2010}}</ref>

At age 8, Nadal won an under-12 regional tennis championship at a time when he was also a promising football player.<ref name="timesonline">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article708386.ece|title= The Big Interview: Rafael Nadal|work=The Sunday Times|date=23 April 2006|first=Alison|last= Kervin |accessdate=5 April 2010 }}</ref> This made Toni Nadal intensify training, and it was at that time that his uncle encouraged Nadal to play left-handed for a natural advantage on the tennis court, after studying Nadal's then [[forehand#Two-handed forehand|two-handed forehand]] stroke.<ref name="timesonline" />

At age 12, Nadal won the Spanish and European tennis titles in his age group, while also playing football.<ref name="timesonline" /> Nadal's father made him choose between football and tennis so that his school work would not deteriorate entirely. Nadal said: "I chose tennis. Football had to stop straight away."<ref name="timesonline" />

When he was 14, the Spanish tennis federation requested that Nadal leave Mallorca and move to [[Barcelona]] to continue his tennis training. His family turned down this request, partly because they feared his education would suffer,<ref name="timesonline" /> but also because Toni said that "I don't want to believe that you have to go to America, or other places to be a good athlete. You can do it from your home."<ref name="Rajaraman" /> The decision to stay home meant less financial support from the federation; instead, Nadal's father covered the costs. In May 2001, he defeated former Grand Slam tournament champion [[Pat Cash]] in a clay-court exhibition match.<ref name="times" />

== Professional tennis career ==
=== 2001–2004: Early career and Davis Cup title ===

Two weeks later, he handed Roger Federer his first loss of the year in the final of the [[Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai Duty Free Men's Open]] (in 2006, Rafael Nadal and [[Andy Murray]] were the only two men who defeated Federer). To complete the spring hard-court season, Nadal was upset in the semifinals of the [[Indian Wells Masters|Pacific Life Open]] in [[Indian Wells, California]], by James Blake, and was upset in the second round of the [[2006 Miami Masters]].

On European [[clay court|clay]], Nadal won all four tournaments he entered and 24 consecutive matches. He defeated Federer in the final of the [[Monte Carlo Masters|Masters Series Monte Carlo]] in four sets. The following week, he defeated [[Tommy Robredo]] in the final of the [[Torneo Godó|Open Sabadell Atlántico]] tournament in [[Barcelona]]. After a one-week break, Nadal won the Masters Series [[Rome Masters|Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] in Rome, defeating Federer in a fifth-set tiebreaker in the final, after saving two match points and equaling [[Björn Borg]]'s tally of 16 ATP titles won as a teenager. Nadal broke Argentinian [[Guillermo Vilas]]'s 29-year male record of 53 consecutive clay-court match victories by winning his first round match at the [[2006 French Open|French Open]]. Vilas presented Nadal with a trophy, but commented later that Nadal's feat was less impressive than his own because Nadal's winning streak covered two years and was accomplished by adding easy tournaments to his schedule.<ref>{{cite web| first=Greg | last=Garber | title=With Vilas in stands, Nadal makes history | date=31 May 2006 | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french06/news/story?id=2462389&lpos=spotlight&lid=tab4pos1 | work=ESPN Tennis/French06|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=13 November 2008}}</ref> Nadal went on to play Federer in the final of the French Open. The first two sets of the match were hardly competitive, as the rivals traded 6–1 sets.

Nadal was seeded second at Wimbledon, and was two points from defeat against American qualifier [[Robert Kendrick]] in the second round before coming back to win in five sets. In the third round, Nadal defeated No. 20 [[Andre Agassi]] in straight sets in Agassi's last career match at Wimbledon. Nadal also won his next three matches in straight sets, which set up his first Wimbledon final, which was against Federer, who had won this tournament the three previous years. Nadal was the first Spanish man since [[Manuel Santana]] in 1966, to reach the Wimbledon final, but Federer won the match in four sets to win his fourth consecutive [[Wimbledon 2006|Wimbledon]] title.

During the lead up to the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Nadal played the two Masters Series tournaments in North America. He was upset in the third round of the [[Canada Masters|Rogers Cup]] in Toronto and the quarterfinals of the [[Cincinnati Masters|Western & Southern Financial Group Masters]] in [[Cincinnati]]. Nadal was seeded second at the US Open, but lost in the quarterfinals to No. 54 [[Mikhail Youzhny]] of Russia in four sets.

Nadal played only three tournaments the remainder of the year. [[Joachim Johansson]], ranked No. 690, upset Nadal in the second round of the [[Stockholm Open]]. The following week, Nadal lost to [[Tomáš Berdych]] in the quarterfinals of the year's last Masters Series tournament, the [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Mutua Madrileña Masters]] in Madrid. During the round-robin stage of the year-ending [[Tennis Masters Cup]], Nadal lost to [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]] but defeated [[Nikolay Davydenko]] and Robredo. Because of those two victories, Nadal qualified for the semifinals, where he lost to Federer. This was Nadal's third loss in nine career matches with Federer.

Nadal went on to become the first player since [[Andre Agassi]] in 1994–95 to finish the year ranked No. 2 in consecutive years.

=== 2007: Third French Open title ===

{{Main|2007 Rafael Nadal tennis season}}

Nadal started the year by playing in six hard-court tournaments. He lost in the semifinals and first round of his first two tournaments and then lost in the quarterfinals of the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]] to eventual runner-up [[Fernando González]]. After another quarterfinal loss at the [[Dubai Tennis Championships]], he won the [[2007 Indian Wells Masters]], before [[Novak Djokovic]] defeated him in the quarterfinals of the [[2007 Miami Masters]].

He had comparatively more success after returning to Europe to play five clay-court tournaments. He won the titles at the [[Monte Carlo Masters|Masters Series Monte Carlo]], the [[Torneo Godo|Open Sabadell Atlántico]] in Barcelona, and the Masters Series [[Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] in Rome, before losing to Roger Federer in the final of the [[Masters Series Hamburg]]. This defeat ended his 81-match winning streak on clay, which is the male Open Era record for consecutive wins on a single surface. He then rebounded to win the [[2007 French Open – Men's Singles|French Open]] for the third straight year, defeating Federer once again in the final. Between the tournaments in Barcelona and Rome, Nadal defeated Federer in the "[[Battle of Surfaces]]" exhibition match in Mallorca, Spain, with the tennis court being half [[grass court|grass]] and half clay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebattleofsurfaces.com | title = The Battle of Surfaces | accessdate =4 April 2007}}</ref>

Nadal played the [[Artois Championships]] at the [[Queen's Club]] in London for the second consecutive year. As in 2006, Nadal was upset in the quarterfinals. Nadal then won consecutive five-set matches during the third and fourth rounds of [[2007 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon]] before being beaten by Federer in the five-set final. This was Federer's first five-set match at Wimbledon since 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/6280788.stm|title=Wimbledon 2007|publisher=BBC Sport |first=Caroline|last=Cheese|date=7 July 2007|accessdate=13 November 2008}}</ref> In July, Nadal won the clay court [[Mercedes Cup]] in [[Stuttgart]], which proved to be his last title of the year. He played three important tournaments during the North American summer hard court season. He was a semifinalist at the Masters Series [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Rogers Cup]] in Montreal before losing his first match at the [[Western & Southern Financial Group Masters]] in [[Cincinnati]]. He was the second-seeded player at the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], but was defeated in the fourth round by [[David Ferrer]].

After a month-long break from tournament tennis, Nadal played the [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Mutua Madrileña Masters]] in Madrid and the [[BNP Paribas Masters]] in Paris. [[David Nalbandian]] upset him in the quarterfinals and final of those tournaments. To end the year, Nadal won two of his three-round robin matches to advance to the semifinals of the [[Tennis Masters Cup]] in Shanghai, where Federer defeated him in straight sets.

During the second half of the year, Nadal battled a knee injury suffered during the Wimbledon final. In addition, there were rumors at the end of the year that the foot injury he suffered during 2005, caused long-term damage, which were given credence by coach [[Toni Nadal]]'s claim that the problem was "serious". Nadal and his spokesman strongly denied this, however, with Nadal himself calling the story "totally false".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7117076.stm|title=Nadal plays down foot injury fear |work=BBC Sport Tennis|first=Piers|last= Newbury|date=28 November 2007|accessdate =11 February 2009 }}</ref>

=== 2008: Two majors, Olympic gold, second Davis Cup, No. 1 ranking ===

{{Main|2008 Rafael Nadal tennis season}}

Nadal began the year in India, where he was comprehensively beaten by [[Mikhail Youzhny]] in the final of the [[Chennai Open]]. Nadal then reached the semifinals of the [[2008 Australian Open|Australian Open]] for the first time. [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]] defeated Nadal in the semifinal of 2008 Australian Open. Nadal also reached the final of the [[2008 Miami Masters|Miami Masters]] for the second time.

During the spring clay-court season, Nadal won four singles titles and defeated Roger Federer in three finals.

By winning his first Wimbledon title, Nadal became the third man in the open era to win both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year, after [[Rod Laver]] in 1969, and Borg in 1978–1980, (Federer later accomplished this the following year) as well as the second Spaniard to win Wimbledon. He also ended Federer's record streak of five consecutive Wimbledon titles and 65 straight wins on grass courts. This was also the first time that Nadal won two Grand Slam tournaments back-to-back.

After Wimbledon, Nadal extended his winning streak to a [[ATP Tour records#Winning streaks|career-best 32 matches]]. He won his second [[2008 Canada Masters|Rogers Cup]] title in Toronto, and then made it into the semifinals of the [[2008 Cincinnati Masters|Western & Southern Financial Group Masters]] in [[Cincinnati]]. As a result, Nadal clinched the [[2008 US Open Series|US Open Series]] and, combined with Federer's early-round losses in both of those tournaments, finally earned the [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|world No. 1]] ranking on 18 August, officially ending Federer's record four-and-a-half-year reign at the top.

At the [[2008 Beijing Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]], Nadal defeated [[Fernando González]] of Chile in the final to win his first Olympic gold medal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennis.com/news/news.aspx?id=142024|title=Nadal wins Olympic gold over Gonzalez|publisher=Tennis.com|date=17 August 2008|accessdate=5 April 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615205322/http://tennis.com/news/news.aspx?id=142024|archivedate=15 June 2009}}</ref>

At the [[2008 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Nadal was the top-seeded player for the first time at a Grand Slam tournament. He did not lose a set during his first three matches, defeating qualifiers in the first and second rounds and [[Viktor Troicki]] in the third round. In the semifinals, he lost to Andy Murray. Later in the year in [[Madrid]], Nadal helped Spain defeat the United States in the [[Davis Cup]] semifinals.

At the [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Mutua Madrileña Masters]] in Madrid, Nadal lost in the semifinals to [[Gilles Simon]]. However, his performance at the event guaranteed that he would become the first Spaniard during the open era to finish the year ranked No. 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/2008news/nadalno1.asp |title=Nadal Clinches Year End No. 1 For First Time |publisher=ATPtennis.com |date=18 August 2008 |accessdate=20 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022030531/http://www.atptennis.com/1/en/2008news/nadalno1.asp |archivedate=22 October 2008 }}</ref> Two weeks later at the [[BNP Paribas Masters]] in Paris, Nadal reached the quarterfinals, where he withdrew because of a knee injury.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/tennisNews/idUKLV49845520081031|title=UPDATE 2-Tennis-Knee injury forces Nadal to retire in Paris |first=Julien|last= Pretot|agency=Reuters|accessdate=5 April 2009 | date=31 October 2008}}</ref> The following week, Nadal announced his withdrawal from the year-ending [[Tennis Masters Cup]] in Shanghai, citing [[tendinitis]] of the knee.

Nadal defeated Raonic and [[Grigor Dimitrov]] in the quarterfinal and semifinal, respectively (the latter lasting for five sets over five hours), to set up a final against [[Roger Federer]], his first Grand Slam final since he won the 2014 French Open. Nadal went on to lose to Federer in five sets; this was the first time that Nadal had lost to Federer in a Grand Slam since the final of the 2007 Wimbledon Championships.

Nadal made it to the final of [[2017 Abierto Mexicano Telcel|Acapulco]] without dropping a set, but was defeated by big-serving [[Sam Querrey]].

=== 2018: 11th French Open title ===
{{Main|2018 Rafael Nadal tennis season}}
Nadal began his 2018 season at the [[Kooyong Classic]], where he lost to [[Richard Gasquet]] in the first round. He then played at the [[Tie Break Tens#2018: Melbourne|Tie Break Tens]] exhibition tournament in Melbourne, losing in the final to [[Tomáš Berdych]]. At the [[2018 Australian Open – Men's Singles|Australian Open]], Nadal recorded straight-sets wins in the first three rounds, before notching a tougher four-set win against [[Diego Schwartzman]] in the fourth round. He faced [[Marin Čilić]] in the quarterfinal, but retired in the fifth set due to a hip injury.<ref>{{cite news|last=Imhoff|first=Dan|title=Cilic back in semis after Nadal's retirement|url=https://ausopen.com/articles/match-report/cilic-back-semis-after-nadals-retirement|work=ausopen.com|date=23 January 2018|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref>

On 16 February, Nadal dropped to the No. 2 ranking after 26 weeks at the top when his rival Roger Federer overtook him in points. Nadal withdrew from the [[Mexican Open (tennis)|Mexican Open]], [[2018 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells Masters]], and [[Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Open]] due to an injury. Despite his absence in Miami, he regained the No. 1 ranking on 2 April due to Federer's second-round loss. After recovering from injury, Nadal helped secure the Spanish Davis Cup team a victory over Germany in the quarterfinal of the World Group. He beat [[Philipp Kohlschreiber]] and [[Alexander Zverev]] in straight sets.<ref>{{cite news | title=Davis Cup: Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer put Spain into semi-finals | publisher=BBC Sport | date=2018-04-08 | url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/43692749 | access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref>

At the [[Monte Carlo Masters]], Nadal successfully defended his title and won a record-breaking 31st Masters title, thus becoming the player with the most Masters 1000 titles in tennis history. It also marked his 11th title in Monte Carlo, as well as the 76th title in his career. Because he defended the points won the previous year, he kept his No. 1 ranking and began his 171st week as the world No. 1.<ref>[http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/nadal-nishikori-monte-carlo-2018-sunday Nadal Clinches La Undécima] ATP, 22 April 2018</ref>
Nadal won in Monte Carlo without dropping a set, beating [[Kei Nishikori]] in the final. Nadal went on to win his 11th title in [[Barcelona Open (tennis)|Barcelona]], defeating [[Stefanos Tsitsipas]] in straight sets, becoming the first player in the open era to win 400 matches on both clay and hard.<ref>[http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/barcelona-2018-final-nadal-tsitsipas Rafa Romps To 11th Barcelona Title] ATP World Tour, 29 April 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/nadal-400-clay-court-match-wins-tribute Tribute: Rafa Hits 400 Clay-Court Match Wins] ATP World Tour, 29 April 2018</ref> The win marked his 20th ATP 500 series title, which put him back atop the list of most ATP 500 titles, tied with Roger Federer. It also marked his 14th consecutive season with at least one ATP 500 title.

Fresh after achieving the 'Undecima' at Monte Carlo and Barcelona, Nadal had to defend yet another title at [[2018 Mutua Madrid Open – Men's Singles|Madrid]]. He reached the quarterfinals, defeating [[Gael Monfils]] and [[Diego Schwartzman]] in straight sets, to extend his record to 50 consecutive sets won on clay, starting from the [[2017 French Open]]. His win over Schwartzman broke [[John McEnroe]]'s record of 49 straight sets won on a single surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/nadal-thiem-coric-madrid-2018-thursday|title=50 And Counting... – ATP World Tour – Tennis|publisher=}}</ref> McEnroe had previously achieved the record on [[Carpet court|carpet]] in 1984. In a surprise, Nadal lost in straight sets to [[Dominic Thiem]] in the quarterfinals, ending his 21-match and record 50-set winning streaks on clay. He also relinquished his world No. 1 ranking to Federer in the process.

At the [[Rome Masters]], Nadal captured his 8th title in the Italian capital as well as his 78th career title, defeating Alexander Zverev in three sets, thus overtaking John McEnroe in the fourth place on the list of most titles won in the Open Era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/rome-2018-final-nadal-zverev|title=Rafa Reigns In Rome, Returns To No. 1 – ATP World Tour – Tennis|date=20 May 2018}}</ref> It was Nadal's 32nd Masters title – most of any player in the Open Era. With his victory in Rome, Nadal also regained the No. 1 spot from Federer.

Then at the [[2018 French Open – Men's Singles|French Open]], Nadal won his 17th Grand Slam title. This tied [[Margaret Court]]'s record for singles titles at a Grand Slam event (Court won 11 Australian Opens, but seven came when it was the Australian Championships, an amateur event). En route to the title, Nadal dropped only one set, beating [[Dominic Thiem]] in the final in three sets.<ref>[http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/roland-garros-2018-final-nadal-thiem Rafa Rolls To 'La Undécima' At Roland Garros] ATP, 10 June 2018</ref> Nadal became just the fourth man in the Open Era to win three or more major titles after turning 30.

Going into [[2018 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Nadal was ranked world number one, but was seeded second due to Wimbledon's seeding algorithm. He made it to the quarterfinals without dropping set. He then faced #5 seed [[Juan Martín del Potro]], who he defeated in five sets. In the semifinals he faced long-time rival [[Novak Djokovic]], who was aiming to reach his first major final since the [[2016 US Open (tennis)|2016 US Open]]. This match lasted 5 hours and 17 minutes, spread over two days, becoming the second-longest Wimbledon semifinal in history, second only to the match between [[Kevin Anderson (tennis)|Kevin Anderson]] and [[John Isner]] held earlier on the same day. Djokovic defeated Nadal in five sets with the fifth set being 10–8.<ref>{{cite web |title=Novak Djokovic outlasts Rafael Nadal in epic Wimbledon semi-final |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/14/novak-djokovic-rafael-nadal-wimbledon-semi-final |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=16 July 2018}}</ref> This was Nadal's first defeat in the semifinals of a major since the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]], and his first ever defeat in the semifinals of Wimbledon. Despite this, Nadal achieved his best results at Wimbledon since 2011. This performance, combined with [[Roger Federer]]'s unsuccessful title defense, ensured that Nadal retained the world number one ranking after the grass season.

He then won the [[2018 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]], a record-extending 33rd Masters 1000 title.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rafael Nadal and Simona Halep win Rogers Cup titles |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/45164095 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> This was Nadal's first Masters 1000 title win on hard court since 2013. He then withdrew from the [[2018 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati Masters]] to prepare for the US Open. Nadal was the top seed during his title defense at the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. He first faced [[David Ferrer]] in Ferrer's last Grand Slam match, who retired due to injury during the second set. In his semi-final matchup against [[Juan Martin del Potro]], Nadal retired after losing the second set 6–2 due to knee pain. On 31 October, he announced his withdrawal from the [[2018 Rolex Paris Masters|Paris Masters]] due to an abdominal injury and as a result [[Novak Djokovic]] replaced him as world No. 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/46042799|title=Paris Masters: Rafael Nadal out with injury & Roger Federer through|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 October 2018|accessdate=2 November 2018}}</ref>

Nadal was due to start his season at the [[2019 Brisbane International]], but withdrew shortly before his first match due to an injury. He was seeded second at the [[2019 Australian Open – Men's Singles|2019 Australian Open]], and recorded straight-sets wins against [[James Duckworth (tennis)|James Duckworth]], [[Matthew Ebden]], [[Alex de Minaur]], [[Tomáš Berdych]], first-time quarterfinalist [[Frances Tiafoe]] and first-time semifinalist [[Stefanos Tsitsipas]] to reach his fifth Australian Open final. This was the first time that Nadal had advanced to an Australian Open final without losing a set; he had also lost only two service games during this run, both in his first-round match against Duckworth. Nadal lost the final in straight sets to [[Novak Djokovic]], winning only eight games for the match and marking Nadal's first straight-sets loss in a Grand Slam final.

The pair met in their first tournament final in 2008, in Barcelona, where Nadal won in three sets. They met a year later again in the Barcelona final, with Nadal taking the title in straight sets. In 2010, the pair met in their first Masters 1000 final in Rome, where Nadal won in straight sets. Ferrer, however, would get his revenge in the 2011 Australian Open quarterfinal, defeating Nadal in straight sets for the first time in a grand slam.

Their biggest meeting, came in the 2013 French Open final. Ferrer was in his first major final, whereas Nadal was aiming for his 8th title at Roland Garros, and 13th overall.

Ferrer's final grand slam match, however, ended in injury as he was forced to retire in the 2nd set against Nadal. Yet, in his second to last tournament in Barcelona, he would have one more meeting with Nadal. Although it was a straight sets victory it was a close match until the end, with the resilient Ferrer fighting until the last point.

=== Nadal vs. Del Potro ===
Nadal and [[Juan Martin del Potro]] have met 17 times, with Nadal leading {{tennis record|won=11|lost=6}}. Outside the Big 4, no active player has more wins against Nadal than Del Potro. The two have met in many prestigious tournaments, including at 3 of the 4 grand slams. Nadal won their first four meetings between 2007–09, however Del Potro went on to win the next three, including a straight sets victory at the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]] SF (he later went on to win the tournament after defeating [[Roger Federer]] in the final.

Nadal in 2013 also denied Del Potro his first Masters 1000 title, with a victory in 3 sets at the [[2013 BNP Paribas Open|2013 Indian Wells Masters]]. However, Del Potro got his revenge, and had one of his most important victories against Nadal in the SF of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], beating him in three close sets (culminating with a tie break). Del Potro went on to claim the silver medal.

After a long span of injuries with both players, the pair met in a Grand Slam for the first time since the R16 at Wimbledon in 2011 at the [[2017 US Open (tennis)|2017 US Open]].

However the Spaniard was too good for the Czech in the final, and Nadal won in straight sets to take his 11th Grand Slam title. Their next meeting in a Grand Slam came only two years later in the [[2012 Australian Open - Men's Singles|2012 Australian Open]] quarterfinal, where Nadal won in 4 tight sets. Nadal would later go on to lose the [[2012 Australian Open – Men's singles final|final]] to Djokovic in 5 sets. After multiple meetings from 2012–2014, all of which were won by Nadal, the pair met again at the [[2015 Australian Open - Men's Singles|2015 Australian Open]] quarterfinal. Here, after 18 straight losses over 9 years, Berdych was able to claim a win over Nadal, and his only in a Grand Slam against the Spaniard. Berdych won the match in straight sets, including a bagel (6–0) in the second. The two met later in 2015 in Madrid, where Nadal won in straight sets.

After a long gap of 4 years, Nadal and Berdych met most recently at the [[2019 Australian Open - Men's Singles|2019 Australian Open]] R16. After both players had prematurely ended their 2018 seasons with injuries, both had been playing very well in the 2019 season up to that point, with Berdych reaching the final in [[2019 Qatar ExxonMobil Open – Singles|Doha]]. However, like many of their meetings, Nadal dominated the Czech and beat him in straight sets.

== Legacy ==

Nadal stands alone in the Open Era as the player with the most clay court titles (59), and holds an all-time record of 12 French Opens, 11 Monte-Carlo Masters and 11 Barcelona titles. He also stands alone with the longest single surface win streak in matches (clay courts, 81) and in sets (clay courts, 50) in the history of the Open Era. Due to these achievements, many have called Nadal "The King of Clay",{{efn|See:<ref name="Plain Dealer King of Clay">{{cite news |title='King of Clay' Rafael Nadal outlasts Novak Djokovic in stirring

The former tennis player [[Andre Agassi]] picked Nadal as the greatest of all time because of the way the Spaniard "had to deal with Federer, Djokovic, Murray in the golden age of tennis".<ref name="The Daily Telegraph">{{cite news |title=Andre Agassi picks Rafael Nadal ahead of Roger Federer as tennis's greatest all-time player |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/rafaelnadal/10816170/Andre-Agassi-picks-Rafael-Nadal-ahead-of-Roger-Federer-as-tenniss-greatest-all-time-player.html |accessdate=8 June 2014 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=8 May 2014}}</ref> Nadal leads the head-to-head record in Grand Slams against all members of the [[Big Three (tennis)|Big Three]] and he has highest number of Slams won beating a Big Three member en route (13).

Nadal is, along with [[Wilander]], one of two male tennis players to win at least two Grand Slams on three different surfaces (hard, grass and clay). Nadal is also, along with [[Agassi]], one of two male tennis players to win the Olympic Gold in singles and the four Grand Slams in his career, a feat known as [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Golden Slam|Career Golden Slam]]. In 2010, Nadal became the only male tennis player to win Grand Slams on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard courts) the same calendar year. Nadal holds the record for most consecutive years winning a Grand Slam (2005–2014), as well as the record for most outdoor titles (83).

== Playing style and coaching ==

Nadal's playing style and personality can be summarised by [[Jimmy Connors]]: "He's built out of a mold that I think I came from also, that you walk out there, you give everything you have from the very first point to the end no matter what the score. And you're willing to lay it all out on the line and you're not afraid to let the people see that."

Former ATP world no. 1 and coach of Nadal, [[Carlos Moya]], remembers the first time he played Nadal in Germany, when he was 22 and Rafa was just 12. He shared the account in the book "Facing Nadal" by Scoop Malimowski: "I met him for the first time in Stuttgart. He was playing an under 12s and I was playing the Masters event. We actually played that day and he was twelve and I was twenty-two. I think he was a very great player under twelve, he was very shy off court. But then we saw something different on court. But he was very hungry to play and compete and that’s something you could see right away.” <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tennisfiles.com/facing-nadal-book-review|title=Facing Nadal: Symposium of a Champion – Book Review|date=26 October 2015|website=Tennis Files}}</ref>

Nadal generally plays an aggressive, behind-the-[[Tennis court#Dimensions|baseline]] game founded on heavy [[topspin]] groundstrokes, consistency, speedy footwork and tenacious court coverage, thus making him an aggressive counterpuncher.<ref name="ESPN">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon08/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=3472238|title=Nadal Has Improved Virtually Every Aspect of His Game|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=3 July 2008|accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref> Known for his athleticism and speed around the court, Nadal is an excellent defender<ref name="about bio">{{cite news | first=Jeff | last=Cooper | title=Rafael Nadal&nbsp;– Game Profile | url =http://tennis.about.com/od/playersmale/a/nadalgp.htm | accessdate =30 July 2007 }}</ref> who hits well on the run, constructing winning plays from seemingly defensive positions. He also plays very fine dropshots, which work especially well because his heavy topspin often forces opponents to the back of the court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/yourgame/instructionarticles/netgame/netgame.aspx?id=123244|title=Rafael Nadal's Drop Volley|work=Tennis Magazine|date=27 March 2008|accessdate=30 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026221750/http://www.tennis.com/yourgame/instructionarticles/netgame/netgame.aspx?id=123244|archivedate=26 October 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Nadal 4 Monte Carlo 2007.jpg|left|thumb|Nadal at the Monte Carlo Masters in 2007]]
Nadal employs a semi-western grip forehand, often with a "lasso-whip" follow-through, where his left arm hits through the ball and finishes above his left shoulder – as opposed to a more traditional finish across the body or around his opposite shoulder.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.elitetennistraining.com/free-online-tennis-lessons/gripping-the-tennis-racquet/ | title=How To Hold A Tennis Racket | accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.essentialtennis.com/category/video/grips/ | title=Essential Tennis – Rafael Nadal's Forehand Grip Revealed | accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref> Nadal's forehand groundstroke form allows him to hit shots with heavy topspin – more so than many of his contemporaries.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/sports/tennis/27tennis.html |title=More and More Players Deliver Slap to Classic Forehand|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=27 June 2006|accessdate=30 January 2009 | first=Christopher | last=Clarey}}</ref>

San Francisco tennis researcher John Yandell used a high-speed video camera and special software to count the average number of revolutions of a tennis ball hit full force by Nadal. Yandell concluded:

{{quote|The first guys we did were Sampras and Agassi. They were hitting forehands that in general were spinning about 1,800 to 1,900 revolutions per minute.

While Nadal's shots tend to land short of the baseline, the characteristically high bounces his forehands achieve tend to mitigate the advantage an opponent would normally gain from capitalizing on a short ball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/yourgame/instructionarticles/forehand/forehand.aspx?id=56544|title=The Forehand of Rafael Nadal|work=Tennis Magazine|date=15 December 2006|accessdate=30 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304142514/http://tennis.com/yourgame/instructionarticles/forehand/forehand.aspx?id=56544|archivedate=4 March 2009}}</ref> Although his forehand is based on heavy topspin, he can hit the ball deep and flat with a more orthodox follow through for clean winners.

Nadal's serve was initially considered a weak point in his game, although his improvements in both first-serve points won and break points saved since 2005 have allowed him to consistently compete for and win major titles on faster surfaces. Nadal relies on the consistency of his serve to gain a strategic advantage in points, rather than going for [[Serve (tennis)#Serve terminology|service winners]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/2304937/Rafael-Nadal-determined-to-keep-one-step-ahead-of-Roger-Federer.html|title=Rafael Nadal Determined to Keep One Step Ahead of Roger Federer|work=The Daily Telegraph |date=6 July 2008|accessdate=30 January 2009  | first=Clive | last=White}}</ref> However, before the 2010 US Open, he altered his service motion, arriving in the trophy pose earlier and pulling the racket lower during the trophy pose. Before the 2010 U.S. Open, Nadal modified his service grip to a more continental one. These two changes in his serve increased his average speed by around 10&nbsp;mph during the 2010 US Open, maxing out at 135&nbsp;mph (217&nbsp;km), allowing him to win more free points on his serve.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tony Kurdzuk/The Star-Ledger |url=http://www.nj.com/sports/njsports/index.ssf/2010/09/rafael_nadal_has_gotten_a_grip.html |title=12 September 2010 |work=The Star-Ledger |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> Since the 2010 US Open, Nadal's serve speed dropped to previous levels and was again been cited as a need for improvement.<ref>{{cite web|author=Timothy Rapp |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1044134-rafael-nadal-rafa-must-improve-serve-to-beat-novak-djokovic |title=Rafael Nadal: Rafa Must Improve Serve to Beat Novak Djokovic |publisher=Bleacher Report |date= 30 January 2012|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Thomas Skuzinski

Nadal is a clay court specialist in the sense that he has been extremely successful on that surface. He has won 12 times at the French Open, 11 times at Monte Carlo and Barcelona, and nine at Rome. However, Nadal has shed that label owing to his success on other surfaces, including holding simultaneous Grand Slam tournament titles on grass, hard courts, and clay on two separate occasions, winning ten Masters series titles on hard court, and winning the Olympic gold medal on hardcourt.<ref name="ESPN" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/aus09/columns/story?columnist=harwitt_sandra&id=3876694|title=No limit to what Nadal can accomplish|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=1 February 2009|accessdate=1 February 2009}}</ref>

Despite praise for Nadal's talent and skill, in the past, some had questioned his longevity in the sport, citing his build and playing style as conducive to injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/usopen07/news/story?id=2996956|title=Style of play catching up with Rafa?|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=30 August 2007|accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref> Nadal himself has admitted to the physical toll hard courts place on [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP Tour]] players, calling for a reevaluated tour schedule featuring fewer hard court tournaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennis.com/tournaments/2009/australianopen/australianopen.aspx?id=163626|title=Oz Champ Nadal Wants Changes in Tennis Schedule|work=Tennis Magazine|date=2 February 2009|accessdate=2 February 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615164042/http://tennis.com/tournaments/2009/australianopen/australianopen.aspx?id=163626|archivedate=15 June 2009}}</ref> This "longevity" narrative has proved to be inaccurate and pundits today admire his resilience.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2019/09/05/rafael-nadals-astonishing-resilience-should-now-enough-win-even/ | title=Rafael Nadal's astonishing resilience | publisher=The Telegraph | accessdate=14 September 2019}}</ref>
<!-- Nadal is ''not'' a clay-court specialist. Although clay is his best surface, four of his slams have been on non-clay surfaces, he won the Olympic singles gold medal on hard court and has won five Masters titles on hardcourts. Just because clay is his best surface does not make him a claycourt specialist. Sergi Bruguera, Thomas Muster, Alberto Berasategui, Carlos Costa – those are clay-court specialists, none of whom even made a major final other than the French (and all were terrible on grass). Nadal has made five Wimbledon finals and was clearly the second-best player in the world on grass for 2006, and 2007, and 2011, and was the best in 2008, and 2010. That is not counting his Australian Open title, U.S. Open titles, or Olympic gold medal. Nadal has made 10 of his 18 Grand Slam finals outside of clay. -->

Nadal has had several coaches throughout his career.

==== Fundación Rafa Nadal ====
The creation of the Fundación Rafa Nadal took place in November 2007, and its official presentation was in February 2008, at the Manacor Tennis Club in Mallorca, Spain. The foundation will focus on social work and development aid particularly on childhood and youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacionrafanadal.org/ |title=Rafa Nadal Foundation |publisher=Fundacionrafanadal.com |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> On deciding why to start a foundation, Nadal said "This can be the beginning of my future, when I retire and have more time, [...] I am doing very well and I owe society, [...] A month-and-a-half ago I was in [[Chennai]], in India. The truth is we live great here....I can contribute something with my image..." Nadal was inspired by the [[List of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|Red Cross]] benefit match against [[malaria]] with Real Madrid goalkeeper [[Iker Casillas]], recalling, "We raised an amount of money that we would never have imagined. I have to thank Iker, my project partner, who went all out for it, [...] That is why the time has come to set up my own foundation and determine the destination of the money."

Nadal's mother, Ana María Parera, chairs the charitable organization and father Sebastian is vice-chairman. Coach and uncle Toni Nadal and his agent, former tennis player [[Carlos Costa (tennis)|Carlos Costa]], are also involved. Roger Federer has given Nadal advice on getting involved in philanthropy. Despite the fact that poverty in India struck him particularly hard, Nadal wants to start by helping "people close by, in the [[Balearic Islands]], in Spain, and then, if possible, abroad".<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] |url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/185574,rafael-nadal-launches-foundation--feature.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731005012/http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/185574,rafael-nadal-launches-foundation--feature.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 July 2012 |title=Rafael Nadal launches foundation |publisher= Earth Times News |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref>

Nadal lived with his parents and younger sister María Isabel in a five-story apartment building in their hometown of Manacor, Mallorca. In June 2009, Spanish newspaper ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', and then ''[[The New York Times]]'', reported that his parents, Ana María and Sebastián, had separated. This news came after weeks of speculation in Internet posts and message boards over Nadal's personal issues as the cause of his setback.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon09/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=4280346 | publisher=ESPN | title=Personal woes affecting Rafa? | date=23 July 2009}}</ref>
