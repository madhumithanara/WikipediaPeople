'''Charles Milles Manson''' ({{né}} '''Maddox''', November 12, 1934{{snd}}November 19, 2017) was an American criminal and [[cult]] leader. In mid-1967, he formed what became known as the "[[Manson Family]]", a quasi-commune based in California. His followers committed [[Manson Family murders|a series of nine murders]] at four locations in July and August 1969. Although the motive for the murders was disputed by Manson, the Los Angeles County district attorney believed that Manson intended to start a [[race war]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Goodbye Helter Skelter|last=Stimson|first=George|publisher=The Peasenhall Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-9913725-8-4|location=California|pages=5}}</ref> In 1971, he was convicted of first-degree murder and [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to commit murder for the [[Tate murders|deaths of seven people]], including the film actress [[Sharon Tate]]. The prosecution conceded that Manson never literally ordered the murders, but they contended that his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/61/102.html|title=People v. Manson|website=Justia Law|language=en|access-date=2019-05-11}}</ref> Manson was also convicted of first-degree murder for the deaths of Gary Hinman and [[Donald Shea]].

Before the murders, Manson had spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions. When he began gathering his cult following, he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the [[Los Angeles]] music industry, chiefly through a chance association with [[Dennis Wilson]] of [[the Beach Boys]], who introduced Manson to record producer [[Terry Melcher]]. In 1968, the Beach Boys recorded Manson's song "Cease to Exist", re-titled "[[Never Learn Not to Love]]" as the B-side on one of their singles, but without a credit to Manson. Wilson and Melcher severed ties with Manson around early 1969.

The Los Angeles district attorney said that Manson was obsessed with [[the Beatles]], particularly their [[The Beatles (album)|1968 self-titled album]]. Manson had claimed to be guided by his interpretation of the Beatles' lyrics and adopted the term "[[Helter Skelter (scenario)|Helter Skelter]]" to describe an impending apocalyptic race war. At trial, the prosecution submitted that Manson and his followers believed that the murders would help precipitate that war. Other contemporary interviews and those who testified during Manson's trial insisted that the Tate–LaBianca murders were [[copycat crime]]s designed to exonerate Manson's friend [[Bobby Beausoleil]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/manson-murders-motive-copycat.php|title=Manson Murders Motive {{!}} Copycat Motive|website=www.cielodrive.com |access-date=2019-05-11}}</ref><ref name=":0">Day, James Buddy (Director). 2017.

Manson's notoriety as an emblem of insanity, violence, and the macabre has also influenced pop culture. Recordings of [[Charles Manson discography|songs written and performed by Manson]] were released commercially, starting with ''[[Lie: The Love and Terror Cult]]'' (1970). Various musicians have covered [[List of covers of Charles Manson songs|some of his songs]].  Although originally sentenced to death, his sentence was commuted to life with the possibility of parole after the California Supreme Court invalidated the state's death penalty statute in 1972. He served his life sentence at [[California State Prison, Corcoran]] and died at age 83 in late 2017.

Charles Manson was born on November 12, 1934, to 16-year-old Kathleen Manson-Bower-Cavender,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theclever.com/15-lesser-known-facts-about-charles-manson/ |title=15 Lesser-Known Facts About The Late Charles Manson |date=November 21, 2017 |publisher=The Clever |last=Woods |first=Jared |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129074434/https://www.theclever.com/15-lesser-known-facts-about-charles-manson/ |archivedate=November 29, 2017 |df=mdy-all |access-date=November 22, 2017 }}</ref> née Maddox (1918–1973),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Manson,Charles.html |title=Internet Accuracy Project: Charles Manson, a website dedicated to providing accurate information on the web |publisher=Accuracyproject.org |access-date=October 28, 2012}}</ref> in the [[University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]].

Manson's biological father appears to have been Colonel Walker Henderson Scott Sr. (1910–1954)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Manson,Charles.html |title=''Internet Accuracy Project: Charles Manson'' |publisher=Accuracyproject.org |access-date=October 28, 2012}}</ref> of [[Catlettsburg, Kentucky]], against whom Kathleen Maddox filed a [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] suit that resulted in an [[stipulated judgment|agreed judgment]] in 1937. Manson may never have known his biological father.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}}<ref name="mom" /> Scott worked intermittently in local mills, and also had a local reputation as a [[con artist]]. He allowed Maddox to believe that he was an army colonel, although "Colonel" was merely his given name. When Maddox told Scott that she was pregnant, he told her he had been called away on army business; after several months she realized he had no intention of returning.{{sfn|Guinn|2013|p=22}}

In August 1934, before Manson's birth, Maddox married William Eugene Manson (1909–1961), a "laborer" at a dry cleaning business. Maddox often went on drinking sprees with her brother Luther, leaving Charles with multiple babysitters. They divorced on April&nbsp;30, 1937, after William alleged "gross neglect of duty" by Maddox. Charles retained William's last name, Manson.{{sfn|Guinn|2013|p=23}} On August 1, 1939, Luther and Kathleen Maddox were arrested for assault and robbery. Kathleen and Luther were sentenced to five and ten years of imprisonment, respectively.{{sfn|Guinn|2013|p=27}}

Manson was placed in the home of an aunt and uncle in [[McMechen, West Virginia]].<ref name="ketchup">{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/books/a-new-look-at-charles-manson-by-jeff-guinn.html |title = Long Before Little Charlie Became the Face of Evil |date = August 7, 2013 |work = [[The New York Times]] |access-date = January 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150930225705/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/books/a-new-look-at-charles-manson-by-jeff-guinn.html |archivedate = September 30, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> His mother was paroled in 1942.

=== First offenses===
In an interview with [[Diane Sawyer]], Manson said that when he was nine, he set his school on fire.<ref>"Charles Manson — Diane Sawyer Documentary.</ref> Manson also got in trouble for truancy and petty theft. Although there were a lack of foster home placements, in 1947, at the age of 13, Manson was placed in the [[Gibault School for Boys]] in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], a school for male delinquents run by Catholic priests.{{sfn|Guinn|2013|p=43}}  Gibault was a strict school, where punishment for even the tiniest infraction included beatings with either a wooden paddle or a leather strap. Manson ran away from Gibault and slept in the woods, under bridges, and wherever else he could find shelter.<ref name=":2">{{cite news|first=Al|last=Hunter|title=Charles Manson — Hoosier Juvenile Dilenquent|newspaper=The Weekly View|date=January 22, 2015}}</ref>

Manson fled home to his mother, and spent Christmas 1947 in McMechen, at his aunt and uncle's house.{{sfn|Guinn|2013|pp=37–42}} His mother returned him to Gibault. Ten months later, he ran away to Indianapolis.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dawn|last=Mitchell|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/history/retroindy/2014/01/14/charles-manson/4471927/|title=Retro Indy: Charles Manson, mass murderer and cult leader, spent time in Indiana|newspaper=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|publisher=[[Gannett]]|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|date=January 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2020}}</ref> In 1948, in Indianapolis, Manson committed his first known crime by robbing a grocery store. At first the robbery was simply to find something to eat. However, Manson found a cigar box containing just over a hundred dollars, and he took the money. He used the money to rent a room on Indianapolis's Skid Row and to buy food.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Mercer|date=20 November 2017|accessdate=August 17, 2020|url=https://news.sky.com/story/charles-mansons-life-and-crimes-a-timeline-11135463|title=Charles Manson's life and crimes: a timeline|website=[[Sky News]]}}</ref>

For a time, Manson tried to go straight by getting a job delivering messages for [[Western Union]]. However, he quickly began to supplement his wages through petty theft.<ref name=":2" /> He was eventually caught, and in 1949 a sympathetic judge sent him to [[Boys Town (organization)|Boys Town]], a juvenile facility in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].<ref name=SawyerInterview>Charles Manson - Diane Sawyer Interview.{{clarifyme|date=June 2020}}</ref> After four days at Boys Town, he and fellow student Blackie Nielson obtained a gun and stole a car.

In the investigation that followed, he was linked to his two earlier armed robberies. He was sent to the [[Plainfield Juvenile Correctional Facility|Indiana Boys School]], a strict reform school.<ref>{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Ray|url=https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/in-indiana-charles-manson-was-once-a-14-year-old-lost-little-kid-report/28532/#:~:text=In%20Indiana%2C%20Charles%20Manson%20Was%20Once%20a%20%E2%80%98Lost,the%20Gibault%20School%20for%20Boys%20in%20Terre%20Haute.|title=In Indiana, Charles Manson Was Once a ‘Lost Little Kid': Report|website=NBC Chicago|date=November 20, 2017|accessdate=August 17, 2020}}</ref>

At the school, other students allegedly raped Manson with the encouragement of a staff member, and he was repeatedly beaten. He ran away from the school eighteen times.<ref name=SawyerInterview/> While at the school, Manson developed a self-defense technique he later called the "insane game".  When he was physically unable to defend himself, he would screech, grimace and wave his arms to convince aggressors that he was insane. After a number of failed attempts, he escaped with two other boys in February&nbsp;1951.{{sfn|Guinn|2013|p=45}}{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}} The three escapees were robbing filling stations while attempting to drive to [[California]] in stolen cars when they were arrested in [[Utah]]. For the [[federal crime]] of driving a stolen car across state lines, Manson was sent to [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[National Training School for Boys]].{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=137–146}} On arrival he was given aptitude tests which determined that he was illiterate, but had an above-average [[IQ]] of 109. His case worker deemed him aggressively [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]].{{sfn|Guinn|2013|p=45}}{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}}

=== First imprisonment ===
On a psychiatrist's recommendation, Manson was transferred in October 1951 to Natural Bridge Honor Camp, a [[minimum security]] institution.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}} His aunt visited him and told administrators she would let him stay at her house and would help him find work. Manson had a parole hearing scheduled for February 1952. However, in January, he was caught raping a boy at knifepoint. Manson was transferred to the Federal Reformatory in [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. There he committed a further "eight serious disciplinary offenses, three involving homosexual acts". He was then moved to a [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security]] reformatory at [[Chillicothe, Ohio]], where he was expected to remain until his release on his 21st birthday in November 1955. Good behavior led to an early release in May 1954, to live with his aunt and uncle in McMechen.{{sfn|Guinn|2013|p=52}}

In January 1955, Manson married a hospital waitress named Rosalie Jean Willis.{{sfn|Manson|1988}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}} Around October, about three months after he and his pregnant wife arrived in [[Los Angeles]] in a car he had stolen in Ohio, Manson was again charged with a federal crime for taking the vehicle across state lines. After a psychiatric evaluation, he was given five years' probation. Manson's failure to appear at a Los Angeles hearing on an identical charge filed in [[Florida]] resulted in his March 1956 arrest in Indianapolis. His probation was revoked; he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island|Terminal Island]], [[San Pedro, California]].{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}}

While Manson was in prison, Rosalie gave birth to their son Charles Manson Jr. During his first year at Terminal Island, Manson received visits from Rosalie and his mother, who were now living together in Los Angeles. In March 1957, when the visits from his wife ceased, his mother informed him Rosalie was living with another man. Less than two weeks before a scheduled parole hearing, Manson tried to escape by stealing a car. He was given five years' probation and his parole was denied.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}}

=== Second imprisonment ===
Manson received five years' parole in September 1958, the same year in which Rosalie received a decree of divorce. By November, he was pimping a 16-year-old girl and was receiving additional support from a girl with wealthy parents. In September 1959, he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to cash a forged [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] check, which he claimed to have stolen from a mailbox; the latter charge was later dropped. He received a 10-year [[suspended sentence]] and probation after a young woman named Leona, who had an arrest record for prostitution, made a "tearful plea" before the court that she and Manson were "deeply in love&nbsp;... and would marry if Charlie were freed".{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}} Before the year's end, the woman did marry Manson, possibly so she [[Spousal privilege|would not be required]] to testify against him.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}}

Manson took Leona and another woman to [[New Mexico]] for purposes of prostitution, resulting in him being held and questioned for violating the [[Mann Act]]. Though he was released, Manson correctly suspected that the investigation had not ended. When he disappeared in violation of his probation, a [[Arrest warrant#Bench warrant|bench warrant]] was issued. An [[indictment]] for violation of the Mann Act followed in April 1960.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}} Following the arrest of one of the women for prostitution, Manson was arrested in June in [[Laredo, Texas]], and was returned to Los Angeles. For violating his probation on the check-cashing charge, he was ordered to serve his ten-year sentence.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}}

Manson spent a year trying unsuccessfully to appeal the revocation of his probation. In July 1961, he was transferred from the Los Angeles County Jail to the United States Penitentiary at [[McNeil Island]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. There, he took guitar lessons from [[Barker–Karpis gang]] leader [[Alvin Karpis#Imprisonment|Alvin "Creepy" Karpis]], and obtained from another inmate a contact name of someone at [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] in [[Hollywood]], [[Phil Kaufman (producer)|Phil Kaufman]].<ref>{{cite web |access-date=July 2, 2012 |url=http://www.lostinthegrooves.com/short-bits-2-charles-manson-and-the-beach-boys |work=Lost in the Grooves |title=Short Bits 2 – Charles Manson and the Beach Boys |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718010206/http://www.lostinthegrooves.com/short-bits-2-charles-manson-and-the-beach-boys |archivedate=July 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all |date=April 13, 2006 }}</ref> According to Jeff Guinn's 2013 biography of Manson, his mother moved to Washington State to be closer to him during his McNeil Island incarceration, working nearby as a waitress.<ref name="Rule/Guinn">{{cite magazine |last=Rule |first=Ann |title=There Will Be Blood |journal=The New York Times Book Review |date=August 18, 2013 |page=14 |access-date=}}</ref>

Although the Mann Act charge had been dropped, the attempt to cash the Treasury check was still a federal offense. Manson's September 1961 annual review noted he had a "tremendous drive to call attention to himself", an observation echoed in September 1964.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}} In 1963, Leona was granted a divorce. During the process she alleged that she and Manson had a son, Charles Luther.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}} According to a popular urban legend, Manson auditioned unsuccessfully for [[the Monkees]] in late 1965; this is refuted by the fact that Manson was still incarcerated at McNeil Island at that time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/monkees.asp |title=Did Charles Manson Audition for The Monkees? |website=snopes.com |access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref>

In June 1966, Manson was sent for the second time to Terminal Island in preparation for early release. By the time of his release day on March 21, 1967, he had spent more than half of his 32 years in prisons and other institutions. This was mainly because he had broken federal laws. Federal sentences were, and remain, much more severe than state sentences for many of the same offenses. Telling the authorities that prison had become his home, he requested permission to stay.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}}

The Manson Family developed into a [[doomsday cult]] when Manson became fixated on the idea of an imminent apocalyptic race war between America's Black population and the larger white population.

In early August 1969, Manson encouraged his followers to start Helter Skelter, by committing murders in Los Angeles and making it appear to be racially motivated.

=== Trial ===
The State of California tried Manson for the Tate and LaBianca murders with co-defendants, Leslie Van Houten, Susan Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkel. Co-defendant Tex Watson was tried at a later date after being extradited from Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/judge-allows-tapes-to-be-released-to-lapd-in-probe-into-possible-unsolved-manson-murders|title=Judge allows tapes to be released to LAPD in probe into possible unsolved Manson murders|website=[[Fox News]]|publisher=[[News Corp]]|location=New York City|date=March 27, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2020}}</ref>

The trial began on July 15, 1970.  Manson appeared wearing fringed buckskins, his typical clothing at Spahn Ranch.<ref>Linda Deutch, "'This is crazy’: Former AP reporter remembers Manson trial", AP, Nov. 20, 2017.</ref>

On July 24, 1970 — the first day of testimony—Manson appeared in court with an "X" carved into his forehead. His followers issued a statement from Manson saying "I have "X'd myself from your world".<ref name="imprint">{{cite web |last1=La Ganga |first1=Maria L. |last2=Himmelsbach-Weinstein |first2=Erik |title=Charles Manson's murderous imprint on L.A. endures as other killers have come and gone |url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-07-27/charles-manson-family-murders-50-years-later |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=November 1, 2019 |date=July 28, 2019}}</ref>  The following day, Manson's co-defendants, Van Houten, Atkins, and Krenwinkel, also appeared in court, with an "X" carved in their foreheads.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Erik|last1=Hawkins|first2=Jair|last2=Hilburn|url=https://www.oxygen.com/manson-the-women/crime-time/manson-carved-x-forehead-followers-vigil-courthouse|title=Manson And His Family Carved ‘X’ Into Their Foreheads During Wild Trial|website=[[Oxygen (website)|Oxygen]]|date=August 6, 2019|accessdate=August 17, 2020</ref>

During the trial, Manson and his co-defendants repeatedly interrupted the testimony and mocked the proceedings. All defendants were repeatedly removed from the trial, and forced to listen to testimony from other rooms in the courthouse.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/29/archives/manson-ejected-from-courtroom-strikes-his-lawyer-during-penalty.html|title=MANSON EJECTED FROM COURTROOM|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=January 29, 1971|accessdate=August 17, 2020}}</ref>

Members of the Manson Family camped outside of the courthouse, and held a vigil on a street corner, because they were excluded from the courtroom for being disruptive. Some of Manson's followers also carved crosses into their heads.<ref name="imprint"/> During the trial, members of the Manson Family appeared in saffron robes, and threatened to immolate themselves if Manson was convicted — just as nuns in Vietnam had done in protest of the war.<ref>Linda Deutch, "'This is crazy’: Former AP reporter remembers Manson trial", AP, Nov. 20, 2017.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Osborne |first1=Samuel |title=Charles Manson: Who was the infamous cult leader and what did he do? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/charles-manson-serial-killer-cult-leader-family-crimes-victims-dead-death-sharon-tate-prisoner-a8064721.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|accessdate=November 1, 2019 |date=November 20, 2017}}</ref>     

The State presented dozens of witnesses during the trial. However, its primary witness was [[Linda Kasabian]], who was present during the Tate murders on August 8-9, 1969. Kasabian provided graphic testimony of the Tate murders, which she observed from outside the house. She was also in the car with Manson on the following evening, when he ordered the LaBianca killings. Kasabian spent days on the witness stand, being cross-examined by the defendants' lawyers. After testifying, Kasabian went into hiding for the next forty years.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}}}}

In early August 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] told reporters that he believed that Manson was guilty of the murders, "either directly or indirectly".<ref name="mistrial">{{cite news|first=Michael S.|last=Rosenwald|title=How Charles Manson almost won a mistrial, courtesy of Richard Nixon|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/08/08/how-charles-manson-almost-won-mistrial-courtesy-richard-nixon/|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 8, 2019}}</ref> Manson obtained a copy of the newspaper and held up the headline to the jury.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}} The defendants' attorneys then called for a mistrial, arguing that their clients had allegedly killed far fewer people than "Nixon's war machine in Vietnam".<ref name="mistrial"/> Judge [[Charles H. Older]] polled each member of the jury, to determine whether each juror saw the headline and whether it affected his or her ability to make an independent decision. All of the jurors affirmed that they could still decide independently.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}} Shortly after, the female defendants – Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten – were removed from the room for chanting, "Nixon says we are guilty. So why go on?"{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}}

On October 5, 1970, Manson attempted to kill Judge Older while the jury was present in the room. Manson first threatened Older, and then jumped over his lawyer's table with a sharpened pencil, in the direction of Older. Manson was restrained before reaching the judge. While being led out of the courtroom, Manson screamed at Older, "In the name of Christian justice, someone should cut your head off!" Meanwhile, the female defendants began chanting something in Latin. Judge Older began wearing a .38 caliber pistol to the trial afterwards.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=485–487}}

On November 16, 1970, the State of California rested its case after presenting twenty-two weeks worth of evidence. The defendants then stunned the courtroom by announcing that they had no witnesses to present, and rested their case.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=503–504}}

=== Manson's testimony ===

Immediately after defendants' counsel rested their case, the three female defendants shouted that they wanted to testify. Their attorneys advised the court, in chambers, that they opposed their clients testifying.  Apparently, the female defendants wanted to testify that Manson had had nothing to do with the murders.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|p=507}}

The following day, Manson himself announced that he too wanted to testify. The judge allowed Manson to testify outside the presence of the jury.  He stated as follows: {{quote|These children that come at you with knives, they are your children. You taught them. I didn't teach them. I just tried to help them stand up.  Most of the people at the ranch that you call the Family were just people that you did not want.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|p=507}}}}

Manson continued, equating his actions to those of society at large: {{quote|I know this:  that in your hearts and your souls, you are as much responsible for the Vietnam war as I am for killing these people. ...  I can't judge any of you. I have no malice against you and no ribbons for you. But I think that it is high time that you all start looking at yourselves, and judging the lie that you live in.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=509–510}}}}

Manson concluded, claiming that he too was a creation of a system that he viewed as fundamentally violent and unjust: {{quote|My father is the jailhouse. My father is your system. ... I am only what you made me. I am only a reflection of you. ... You want to kill me? Ha! I am already dead — have been all my life. I've spent twenty-three years in tombs that you have built.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=509–510}}}}  After Manson finished speaking, Judge Older offered to let him testify before the jury.  Manson replied that it was not necessary.  Manson then told the female defendants that they no longer needed to testify.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|p=514}}

On November 30, 1970, Leslie Van Houten's attorney, Ronald Hughes, failed to appear for the closing arguments in the trial.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|p=514}} He was later found dead in a California state park. His body was badly decomposed, and it was impossible to tell the cause of death.  Hughes had disagreed with Manson during the trial, taking the position that his client, Van Houten, should not testify to claim that Manson had no involvement with the murders. Some have alleged that Hughes may have been murdered by the Manson Family.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|p=595}}

On January 25, 1971, the jury found Manson, Krenwinkel and Atkins guilty of first degree murder in all seven of the Tate and LaBianca killings. The jury found Van Houten guilty of murder in the first degree in the LaBianca killings.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=537-539}}

=== Sentencing ===
After the convictions, the court held a separate hearing before the same jury to determine if the defendants should receive the death sentence.  

Each of the three female defendants – Atkins, Van Houten, and Krenwinkel – took the stand. They provided graphic details of the murders and testified that Manson was not involved.  According to the female defendants, they had committed the crimes in order to help fellow Manson Family member [[Bobby Beausoleil]] get out of jail, where he was being held for the murder of [[Gary Hinman]]. The female defendants testified that the Tate-LaBianca murders were intended to be [[copycat crime]]s, similar to the Hinman killing. Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten claimed they did this under the direction of the state's prime witness, [[Linda Kasabian]]. The defendants did not express remorse for the killings.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=560–564}}

On March 4, 1971, during the sentencing hearings, Manson trimmed his beard to a fork and shaved his head, telling the media, "I am the Devil, and the Devil always has a bald head!" However, the female defendants did not immediately shave their own heads. The state prosecutor, Vincent Bugliosi, later speculated in his book, ''Helter Skelter'', that they refrained from doing so, in order to not appear to be completely controlled by Manson (as they had when they each carved an "X" in their foreheads, earlier in the trial).{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=571–572}}

On March 29, 1971, the jury sentenced all four defendants to death. When the female defendants were led into the courtroom, each of them had shaved their heads, as had Manson. After hearing the sentence, Atkins shouted to the jury, "Better lock your doors and watch your kids."{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=592–594}}

The Manson murder trial was the longest murder trial in American history when it occurred, lasting nine and a half months. The trial was among the most publicized American criminal cases of the twentieth century and was dubbed the "[[trial of the century]]". The jury had been sequestered for 225 days, longer than any jury before it. The trial transcript alone ran to 209 volumes or 31,716 pages.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=592–594}}

Manson was admitted to state prison from Los Angeles County on April 22, 1971, for seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of Abigail Ann Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Steven Earl Parent, Sharon Tate Polanski, Jay Sebring, and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. As the death penalty was ruled unconstitutional in 1972, Manson was re-sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. His initial death sentence was modified to life on February&nbsp;2, 1977. 

On December 13, 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder in Los Angeles County Court for the July 25, 1969 death of musician Gary Hinman. He was also convicted of first-degree murder for the August 1969 death of Donald Jerome "Shorty" Shea. Following the 1972 decision of ''[[People v. Anderson|California v. Anderson]]'', California's death sentences were ruled unconstitutional and that "any prisoner now under a sentence of death ... may file a petition for writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in the superior court inviting that court to modify its judgment to provide for the appropriate alternative punishment of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without possibility of parole specified by statute for the crime for which he was sentenced to death."<ref>[http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/6C3d628.htm ''People v.

=== Relationships and alleged child ===
In 2009, Los Angeles disk jockey Matthew Roberts released correspondence and other evidence indicating that he might be Manson's biological son. Roberts' biological mother claims that she was a member of the Manson Family who left in mid-1967 after being raped by Manson; she returned to her parents' home to complete the pregnancy, gave birth on March 22, 1968, and put Roberts up for adoption. CNN conducted a DNA test between Matthew Roberts and Manson's known biological grandson Jason Freeman in 2012, showing that Roberts and Freeman did not share DNA.<ref name="specter">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/04/23/us/ohio-manson-grandson/index.html|title=Two men relate to same haunting specter – Charles Manson|last=Marquez|first=Miguel|publisher=CNN|date=April 24, 2012|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> Roberts subsequently attempted to establish that Manson was his father through a direct DNA test which proved definitively that Roberts and Manson were not related.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/charles-mansons-body-is-on-ice-under-a-fake-name-10|title=The Battle Over Charles Manson's Corpse|first=Kate|last=Briquelet|date=March 8, 2018|website=Daily Beast}}</ref>

=== Psychology ===
On April 11, 2012, Manson was denied release at his 12th parole hearing, which he did not attend. After his March 27, 1997 parole hearing, Manson refused to attend any of his later hearings. The panel at that hearing noted that Manson had a "history of [[Abusive power and control|controlling behavior]]" and "mental health issues" including schizophrenia and [[Paranoia#Paranoid social cognition|paranoid delusional disorder]], and was too great a danger to be released.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/charles-manson-quickly-denied-parole.html |title=Charles Manson Quickly Denied Parole |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=April 11, 2012 |access-date=April 11, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411181326/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/charles-manson-quickly-denied-parole.html |archivedate=April 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The panel also noted that Manson had received 108 rules violation reports, had no indication of remorse, no insight into the causative factors of the crimes, lacked understanding of the magnitude of the crimes, had an exceptional, callous disregard for human suffering and had no parole plans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cielodrive.com/charles-manson-parole-hearing-2012.php |title=Parole Hearing: Charles Manson 2012|website=cielodrive.com |access-date=November 4, 2017 }}</ref> At the April 11, 2012, parole hearing, it was determined that Manson would not be reconsidered for parole for another 15 years, i.e. not before 2027, at which time he would have been 92 years old.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Kiki |url=http://www.kionrightnow.com/story/17385763/charles-manson-denied-parole |title=Murderer Charles Manson Denied Parole – Central Coast News KION/KCBA |publisher=Kionrightnow.com |date=April 11, 2012 |access-date=August 19, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413172109/http://www.kionrightnow.com/story/17385763/charles-manson-denied-parole |archivedate=April 13, 2012 }}{{cite web |url=http://www.pressherald.com/2012/04/11/manson-skips-12th-parole-hearing-may-be-his-last/ |title=Mass murderer Charles Manson denied parole |access-date=November 18, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118190205/http://www.pressherald.com/2012/04/11/manson-skips-12th-parole-hearing-may-be-his-last/ |archivedate=November 18, 2015 |df=mdy-all |date=April 11, 2012}}</ref>

{{See also|Charles Manson discography}}

Manson was a struggling musician, seeking to make it big in Hollywood between 1967 and 1969. The [[Beach Boys]] did a cover of one of his songs.  Other songs were publicly released only after the trial for the Tate murders started. On March 6, 1970, ''[[Lie: The Love and Terror Cult|LIE]]'', an album of Manson music, was released.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|p=258-269}}{{sfn|Sanders|2002|p=336}}<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000005X1J ''Lie: The Love And Terror Cult''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228180319/http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000005X1J |date=February 28, 2008}}.
