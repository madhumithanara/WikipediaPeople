Lawrence traveled to the Ozarks a week before filming began to live with the family on whom the story was based, and in preparation, she learned to fight, skin squirrels, and chop wood.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rodriquez|first=Alberto|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/people-news/46010/winters-bone-hunger-games-jennifer-lawrences-rise|title=Winter's Bone to Hunger Games: Jennifer Lawrence's rise|work=[[The Week]]|date=March 23, 2012|accessdate=May 2, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701201606/http://www.theweek.co.uk/people-news/46010/winters-bone-hunger-games-jennifer-lawrences-rise|archivedate=July 1, 2016|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/jennifer-lawrence-winters-bone|title=Survival of the Fittest: Jennifer Lawrence and Winter's Bone|work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]|date=June 14, 2010|accessdate=May 20, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814133607/http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/jennifer-lawrence-winters-bone|archivedate=August 14, 2016|df=}}</ref> [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said the film "would be unimaginable with anyone less charismatic",<ref>{{cite news|last1=Denby|first1=David|authorlink=David Denby (film critic)|date=July 5, 2010|title=Current Cinema: Thrills and Chills|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|pages=78–79|url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2010/07/05/100705crci_cinema_denby|accessdate=May 12, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228202748/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2010/07/05/100705crci_cinema_denby|archivedate=February 28, 2011|df=}}</ref> and [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that "her performance is more than acting, it's a gathering storm.

In 2012 she played [[Katniss Everdeen]] in ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'', an adaptation of the first book in author [[Suzanne Collins]]' [[The Hunger Games|''Hunger Games'' trilogy]].

Despite being an admirer of the books, Lawrence was initially hesitant to accept the part, because of the grand scale of the film.
