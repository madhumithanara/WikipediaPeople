==Early life==
Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. was born on September 27, 1982, and spent his first few years in the impoverished [[Hollygrove, New Orleans|Hollygrove]] neighborhood of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].<ref name="allmusicguide">{{cite web|last=Jeffries|first=David|title=Lil Wayne&nbsp;– Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p384397|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|year=2010|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}</ref> His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was 2 and his father permanently abandoned the family. When CBS interviewer [[Katie Couric]] asked why he used the name Wayne instead of his given name, Carter explained that "I dropped the D because I'm a junior and my father is living and he's not in my life and he's never been in my life. So I don't want to be Dwayne, I'd rather be Wayne". Asked if his father knew of this, Carter replied, "He knows now".<ref name="Couric2">{{cite news|last=Couric|first=Katie|date=February 4, 2009|title="All Access:" Lil' Wayne|publisher=CBS News|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/04/entertainment/grammy2009/main4775952.shtml|accessdate=February 7, 2009}}</ref>

Although Carter and Birdman have a father-son relationship and Birdman calls Carter his son, Carter has said that he considers deceased stepfather Reginald "Rabbit" McDonald his real father.

===1999–2004: ''Tha Block Is Hot'', ''Lights Out'', and ''500 Degreez''===
Carter's debut solo album, ''[[Tha Block Is Hot]]'', was released when he was 17 and featured significant contributions from the [[Hot Boys]]. It debuted at number 3 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was later certified platinum by the [[RIAA]].<ref name="allmusicguide"/> The album earned Carter a 1999 ''[[The Source (magazine)|Source]]'' magazine nomination for "Best New Artist",<ref name="cash money">{{cite web|title=Lil Wayne – Tha Carter II|url=http://www.lilwayne-online.com/bio.asp|publisher=[[Cash Money Records]]|year=2005|accessdate=March 29, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080322174356/http://www.lilwayne-online.com/bio.asp |archivedate = March 22, 2008}}</ref> and also became a Top Ten hit.<ref name="allmusicguide"/> The lead single was "[[Tha Block Is Hot (song)|Tha Block Is Hot]]".

Carter's verse appeared only on the radio version of the song, while on the album version he performed on the chorus.

His second album, ''[[Lights Out (Lil Wayne album)|Lights Out]]'', was released in 2000, and failed to attain the level of success achieved by his debut<ref name="allmusicguide"/> but was certified gold by RIAA.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|title=Gold and Platinum – Lil Wayne|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Lil%20wayne&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=CertificationDate&perPage=50|publisher=RIAA|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}</ref> Critics noted the lack of coherent narratives in his verses as evidence that he had yet to mature to the level of his fellow Hot Boys.<ref>{{cite web|last=Juon|first=Steve|title=Lil Wayne – "Lights Out"|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2001_01_lightsout.html |work=RapReviews.com|date=January 6, 2001|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}</ref> The lead single was "Get Off the Corner", which was noticed for an improvement in its lyrical content and style.

Carter's third album, ''[[500 Degreez]]'', was released in 2002. It followed the format of his previous two, with significant contributions from the Hot Boys and [[Mannie Fresh]].

[[File:LIL' WAYNE.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Lil Wayne performing at Voodoo Music Experience in 2008.]]
Instead of a follow-up solo album, Carter began to reach his audience through a plethora of mixtapes and guest appearances on a variety of pop and hip hop singles.<ref name="allmusicguide"/> Of his many mixtapes, ''[[Dedication 2]]'' and ''[[Da Drought 3]]'' received the most media exposure and critical review. ''Dedication 2'', released in 2006, paired Carter with DJ Drama and contained the acclaimed socially conscious track "Georgia Bush", in which Carter critiqued former US president [[George W. Bush]]'s response to the effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]] on the city of New Orleans. ''Da Drought 3'' was released the following year and was available for free legal download. It contained Carter rapping over a variety of beats from recent hits by other musicians.

==Feuds==

=== Juvenile ===
Carter began feuding with former [[Hot Boys]] member and [[Cash Money Records]] labelmate [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]] in 2002, after Juvenile took offense to Carter naming his third studio album ''[[500 Degreez]]'', a diss aimed towards Juvenile whose last album was named ''[[400 Degreez]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dhar|first=Pooja|url=https://www.republicworld.com/entertainment-news/hollywood-news/lil-wayne-feuds-and-controversies-that-you-might-not-know-of.html|title=Lil Wayne feuds and controversies|date= January 9, 2020|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> Juvenile responded with a diss track on his 2002 album ''600 Degreez'', titled "A Hoe".
