Williams and Reeve had a class in dialects taught by Edith Skinner, who Reeve said was one of the world's leading voice and speech teachers; according to Reeve, Skinner was bewildered by Williams and his ability to instantly perform in many different accents. Their primary acting teacher was [[Michael Kahn (theatre director)|Michael Kahn]], who was "equally baffled by this human dynamo".<ref name="reeve" /> Williams already had a reputation for being funny, but Kahn criticized his antics as simple stand-up comedy.

Reeve wrote, "He simply ''was'' the old man.

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy===

[[File:Robin Williams in Camp Phoenix.jpg|thumb|Williams at a [[United Service Organization|USO]] show on December 20, 2007]]

Williams began performing stand-up comedy in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hartlaub|first=Peter|last2=August 12|first2=Leah Garchik {{!}} on|last3=2014|date=2014-08-12|title=Robin Williams' heart never strayed far from San Francisco|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Robin-Williams-heart-never-strayed-far-from-San-5682602.php|access-date=2020-06-27|website=www.sfgate.com|language=en}}</ref> He gave his first performance at the [[Holy City Zoo]], a comedy club in [[San Francisco]], where he worked his way up from tending bar.<ref name=Zehme/> In the 1960s, San Francisco was a center for a [[rock music]] renaissance, [[hippie]]s, [[Recreational drug use|drugs]], and a [[sexual revolution]], and in the late 1970s, Williams helped lead its "comedy renaissance", writes critic [[Gerald Nachman]].<ref name=Nachman>{{cite book|first=Gerald|last=Nachman|title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s|publisher=Back Stage Books|location=Brno, Czech Republic|date=2004|isbn=978-0823047864}}</ref>{{rp|6}} Williams says he found out about "drugs and happiness" during that period, adding that he saw "the best brains of my time turned to mud."<ref name=Maslon/>

Williams moved to Los Angeles and continued performing stand-up at clubs including [[The Comedy Store]]. There, in 1977, he was seen by TV producer [[George Schlatter]], who asked him to appear on a revival of his show [[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In|''Laugh-In'']]. The show aired in late 1977 and was his debut TV appearance.<ref name=Maslon/> That year, Williams also performed a show at the [[The Improv|L.A.

With his success on ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'', Williams began to reach a wider audience with his stand-up comedy, starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, including three [[HBO]] comedy specials: ''Off The Wall'' (1978), ''An Evening with Robin Williams'' (1983), and ''[[A Night at the Met]]'' (1986).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Benedictus|first1=Leo|date=December 6, 2012|title=Comedy gold: Robin Williams' A Night at the Met|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/06/robin-williams-night-met-comedy-gold|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref> Williams won a [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]] for the recording of his 1979 live show at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] in [[New York City|New York]], ''Reality{{nbsp}}...

[[David Letterman]], who knew Williams for nearly 40 years, recalls seeing him first perform as a new comedian at [[The Comedy Store]] in Hollywood, where Letterman and other comedians had already been doing stand-up. "He came in like a hurricane," said Letterman, who said he then thought to himself, "Holy crap, there goes my chance in show business."<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last=Lockett|first=Dee|date=August 19, 2014|title=Letterman Remembers the First Time He Met Robin Williams|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/08/19/david_letterman_s_robin_williams_tribute_the_late_show_host_remembers_when.html|accessdate=October 23, 2014|website=Slate}}</ref>
[[File:Robin Williams Aviano.jpg|thumb|upright|Williams at [[Aviano Air Base]] (Italy) on December 22, 2007]]

Williams said that partly due to the stress of performing stand-up, he started using [[drug]]s and [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] early in his career. He further said that he neither drank nor took drugs while on stage, but occasionally performed when [[Hangover|hung over]] from the previous day. During the period he was using [[cocaine]], he said it made him [[Paranoia|paranoid]] when performing on stage.<ref name="Grobel">{{cite magazine|first=Lawrence|last=Grobel|title=Playboy Interview: Robin Williams|magazine=[[Playboy]]|publisher=[[Playboy Enterprises]]|location=Beverly Hills, California|date=January 1992}}</ref>

Williams once described the life of stand-up comedians:
{{cquote|It's a brutal field, man. They burn out. It takes its toll. Plus, the lifestyle—partying, drinking, drugs. If you're on the road, it's even more brutal. You gotta come back down to mellow your ass out, and then performing takes you back up. They flame out because it comes and goes. Suddenly they're hot, and then somebody else is hot. Sometimes they get very bitter. Sometimes they just give up. Sometimes they have a revival thing and they come back again. Sometimes they snap. The pressure kicks in. You become obsessed and then you lose that focus that you need.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|34–35}}}}

Some, such as the critic [[Vincent Canby]], were concerned that his monologues were so intense it seemed as though at any minute his "creative process could reverse into a complete meltdown."<ref name="When the Laughter Stops">{{cite book | title=Robin Williams: When the Laughter Stops 1951–2014 | first=Emily | last=Herbert | publisher=John Blake Publishing Ltd. | location=London, England | date=November 15, 2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9DpUCgAAQBAJ | isbn=9781784183004 | oclc=889523094 | accessdate=August 26, 2016}}</ref> His biographer, Emily Herbert, described his "intense, utterly manic style of stand-up [which sometimes] defies analysis{{nbsp}}...

Williams felt secure that he would not run out of ideas, as the constant change in world events would keep him supplied.<ref name=Grobel/> He also explained that he often used [[Free association (psychology)#Characteristics|free association]] of ideas while improvising in order to keep the audience interested.<ref>{{YouTube|id=4LaJDOD5cJI|time=14m20s|title=Robin Williams—Parkinson interview [2002]}}.

During a ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' interview in 1992, Williams was asked whether he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life. He replied, "There's that fear—if I felt like I was becoming not just dull but a rock, that I still couldn't speak, fire off or talk about things, if I'd start to worry or got too afraid to say something.{{nbsp}}... If I stop trying, I get afraid." While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist [[Jerzy Kosiński]] to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.<ref name=Grobel/>

Williams' stand-up work was a consistent thread through his career, as seen by the success of his one-man show (and subsequent DVD) ''Robin Williams: Live on Broadway'' (2002). In 2004, he was voted 13th on [[Comedy Central]]'s list "100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time".<ref>{{cite web|title=Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time|url=https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0429332/|accessdate=December 26, 2007|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> After a six-year hiatus, in August 2008, Williams announced a new 26-city tour, ''Weapons of Self-Destruction''.

After the ''[[Laugh-In]]'' revival and appearing in the cast of ''[[The Richard Pryor Show]]'' on [[NBC]], Williams was cast by [[Garry Marshall]] as the alien Mork in a 1978 episode of the TV series ''[[Happy Days]]'', "[[My Favorite Orkan]]".<ref name=Maslon/><ref name="actors">{{cite episode | title = Robin Williams | series = Inside the Actors Studio | season = 7 | number = 710 | airdate = June 10, 2001 | network = Bravo | url = http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guest/Robin_Williams | credits = James Lipton (host) | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070204093734/http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guest/Robin_Williams | archivedate = February 4, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Sought after as a last-minute cast replacement for a departing actor, Williams impressed the producer with his quirky sense of humor when he sat on his head when asked to take a seat for the audition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robin Williams Biography |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robin-williams.html |publisher=Biography Channel |accessdate=September 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716212135/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robin-williams.html |archivedate=July 16, 2012 |df= }}</ref> As Mork, Williams improvised much of his dialogue and physical comedy, speaking in a high, nasal voice and made the most of the ill-considered script.

Mork's appearance proved so popular with viewers that it led to the spin-off television sitcom ''Mork & Mindy'', which co-starred [[Pam Dawber]], and ran from 1978 to 1982; the show was written to accommodate his extreme improvisations in dialog and behavior. Although he portrayed the same character as in ''Happy Days'', the series was set in the present in Boulder, Colorado, instead of the late 1950s in [[Milwaukee]]. ''Mork & Mindy'' at its peak had a weekly audience of sixty million and was credited with turning Williams into a "superstar".<ref name="Maslon" /> According to critic [[James Poniewozik]], the series was especially popular among young people as Williams became a "man and a child, buoyant, rubber-faced, an endless gusher of invention".<ref name="Corliss">{{cite journal |last=Corliss |first=Richard |url=http://time.com/3110842/robin-williams-the-heart-of-comedy/ |title=Robin Williams: The Heart of Comedy |journal=Time |date=August 25, 2014}}</ref>

His first starring performance, however, is as the title character in ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980), in which Williams showcased the acting skills previously demonstrated in his television work; accordingly, the film's commercial disappointment was not blamed on his performance.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://articles.philly.com/2014-08-13/news/52732960_1_golden-globe-aladdin-role | title = Robin Williams, 63, comic genius | first = Steven | last = Rea | date = August 13, 2014 | accessdate = August 18, 2014 | work = The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref><ref name="VF-20140812">{{cite web |last=Spitznagel |first=Eric |title=Popeye Is the Best Movie Robin Williams Ever Made |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/08/robin-williams-popeye |date=August 12, 2014 |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=August 13, 2014 }}</ref> He went on to star as the leading character in ''[[The World According to Garp (film)|The World According to Garp]]'' (1982), which Williams considered "may have lacked a certain madness onscreen, but it had a great core."<ref name=Zehme/> He continued with other smaller roles in less successful films, such as ''[[The Survivors (1983 film)|The Survivors]]'' (1983) and ''[[Club Paradise]]'' (1986), though he said these roles did not help advance his film career.<ref name=Zehme/>

His first major break came from his starring role in director [[Barry Levinson]]'s ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'' (1987), which earned Williams a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].<ref name="actors"/> The film is set in 1965 during the [[Vietnam War]], with Williams playing the role of [[Adrian Cronauer]], a radio [[shock jock]] who keeps the troops entertained with comedy and sarcasm. Williams was allowed to play the role without a script, improvising most of his lines. Over the microphone, he created voice impressions of people, including [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Gomer Pyle]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Mr. Ed]], and [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name=Zehme>{{cite news | last = Zehme | first = Bill | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | pages = 29–32 | date = February 25, 1988 | accessdate = August 18, 2014 | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/robin-williams-the-rolling-stone-interview-19880225 | title = Robin Williams: The Rolling Stone Interview }}</ref> "We just let the cameras roll," said producer Mark Johnson, and Williams "managed to create something new for every single take".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Inventing Vietnam: The War in Film and Television|publisher = Temple University Press|year = 1991|isbn = 9780877228622|page = [https://archive.org/details/inventingvietnam0000unse/page/238 238]|series = Culture And The Moving Image: Vol 6|editor-last = Anderegg|editor-first = Michael|location = Philadelphia|url = https://archive.org/details/inventingvietnam0000unse/page/238}}</ref>

Sacks later said the way the actor's mind worked was a "form of genius". In 1991, he played an adult [[Peter Pan]] in the film ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', although he had said he would have to lose 25 pounds for the role.<ref>''Rolling Stone'', February 21, 1991 p. 26.</ref> [[Terry Gilliam]], who co-founded [[Monty Python]] and directed Williams in two of his films, ''[[The Fisher King]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'' (1988), said in 1992 that Williams had the ability to "go from manic to mad to tender and vulnerable{{nbsp}}...

Other performances Williams had in dramatic films include ''[[Moscow on the Hudson]]'' (1984), ''[[Awakenings]]'' (1990), ''[[What Dreams May Come (film)|What Dreams May Come]]'' (1998), and ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' (1999).<ref name="allmovie_bio">{{cite web|last1=Brennan|first1=Sandra|title=Robin Williams|url=https://www.allmovie.com/artist/robin-williams-p116900|accessdate=August 12, 2014|website=[[Allmovie]]}}</ref> In ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'' (2002), Williams portrays a writer / killer on the run from a sleep-deprived Los Angeles policeman (played by [[Al Pacino]]) in rural Alaska.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Karl|title=Insomnia (2002)|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/insomnia-v260290|accessdate=August 12, 2014|website=Allmovie}}</ref> Also in 2002, in the psychological thriller ''[[One Hour Photo]]'', Williams portrays an emotionally disturbed photo development technician who becomes obsessed with a family for whom he has developed pictures for a long time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Deming|first1=Mark|title=One Hour Photo (2002)|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/one-hour-photo-v260306|accessdate=August 12, 2014|website=Allmovie}}</ref> The last film of Williams' released during his lifetime was ''[[The Angriest Man in Brooklyn]]'', a film addressing the value of life in which Williams plays Henry Altmann, a terminally ill man who reassesses his life and works to redeem himself.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The 'Angriest' Robin Williams Sadly Becomes The Inspirational One|language=en|work=NPR.org|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/05/22/313116016/the-angriest-robin-williams-sadly-becomes-the-inspirational-one|access-date=September 13, 2018}}</ref>

His roles in comedy and dramatic films garnered Williams several accolades, including an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role in ''Good Will Hunting'';<ref name="actors" /> as well as two previous Academy Award nominations, for ''Dead Poets Society'', and as a troubled homeless man in ''The Fisher King'', respectively.<ref name="actors" />

Among the actors who helped him during his acting career, he credited Robert De Niro, from whom he learned the power of silence and economy of dialogue when acting. From [[Dustin Hoffman]], with whom he co-starred in ''Hook'', he learned to take on totally different character types, and to transform his characters by extreme preparation. [[Mike Medavoy]], producer of ''Hook'', told its director, [[Steven Spielberg]], that he intentionally teamed up Hoffman and Williams for the film because he knew they wanted to work together, and that Williams welcomed the opportunity of working with Spielberg.<ref>{{cite book|title = You're Only as Good as Your Next One: 100 Great Films, 100 Good Films, and 100 for Which I Should Be Shot|last = Medavoy|first = Mike|publisher = Simon & Schuster (Altria)|year = 2002|isbn = 9780743400541|location = New York|page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743400541/page/n281 228]|others = Young, Josh (contributor)|url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743400541|url-access = registration}}</ref> Williams benefited from working with [[Woody Allen]], who directed him and Billy Crystal in ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997), as Allen had knowledge of the fact that Crystal and Williams had often performed together on stage.<ref>{{cite book|title = Conversations with Woody Allen: His Films, the Movies, and Moviemaking|last = Lax|first = Eric|publisher = Alfred A.

====Voice roles====

[[File:Robin Williams 1996.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Williams in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1996]]

Williams voiced characters in several animated films. His voice role as the [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] in the animated musical ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992) was written for him. The film's directors said they had taken a risk by writing the role.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOo9XqAyxE&t=2m24s|via=[[YouTube]]|title=Turning Robin Williams into 'Aladdin's' Genie|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=August 15, 2014}}</ref> At first, Williams refused the role since it was a Disney movie, and he did not want the studio profiting by selling merchandise based on the movie. He accepted the role with certain conditions: "I'm doing it basically because I want to be part of this animation tradition. I want something for my children. One deal is, I just don't want to sell anything—as in Burger King, as in toys, as in stuff."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/15/robin-williams-almost-didnt-make-aladdin-and-a-generation-of-children-are-grateful-that-he-did/|title=Robin Williams almost didn't make 'Aladdin,' and a generation of children is grateful that he did|last=McDonald|first=Soraya Nadia|date=August 15, 2014|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Williams improvised much of his dialogue, recording approximately 30 hours of tape,<ref name="Kornbluth" /> and impersonated dozens of celebrities, including [[Ed Sullivan]], [[Jack Nicholson]], Robert De Niro, [[Groucho Marx]], [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[William F.

His performance led the way for other animated films to incorporate actors with more star power.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/10/how-celebrities-took-over-cartoon-voice-acting/247481/ |title=How Celebrities Took Over Cartoon Voice Acting |first=Scott |last=Meslow |date=October 28, 2011 |accessdate=August 17, 2014 |journal=[[The Atlantic]]}}</ref> He was named a [[Disney Legends|Disney Legend]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=2009 Disney Legends Award Recipients to Be Honored During D23 Expo in Anaheim {{!}} Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/01/idUS158754+01-Sep-2009+PRN20090901|work=Reuters|accessdate=January 26, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214011248/https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/01/idUS158754+01-Sep-2009+PRN20090901|archivedate=December 14, 2013|date=December 14, 2013}}</ref>

Williams continued to provide voices in other animated films, including ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]'' (1992), ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]'' (2005), ''[[Happy Feet]]'' (2006), and an uncredited vocal performance in ''[[Everyone's Hero]]'' (2006). He also voiced the holographic Dr. Know character in the live-action film ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' (2001). He was the voice of [[The Timekeeper]], a former attraction at the [[Walt Disney World]] Resort about a time-traveling robot who encounters [[Jules Verne]] and brings him to the future.<ref name="Veness2009">{{cite book |last=Veness |first=Susan |title=The Hidden Magic of Walt Disney World: Over 600 Secrets of the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Animal Kingdom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0j1qhFi2fMC&pg=PT74 |year=2009 |publisher=Adams Media |isbn=9781440504327 |page=74}}</ref>

====Later films====

Years after the films, Janet Hirshenson revealed in an interview that Williams had expressed interest in portraying [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' film series, but was rejected by director Chris Columbus due to the "British-only edict".<ref>{{cite web|title=He really wanted to be in the movie|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/robin-williams-was-turned-down-for-a-key-harry-potter-role/news-story/1590a9c7c2dd974a1fa9758053acc97f|website=[[News.com.au]]}}</ref> In 2006, he starred in five movies, including ''[[Man of the Year (2006 film)|Man of the Year]]'' and ''[[The Night Listener (film)|The Night Listener]]'', the latter being a thriller about a radio show host who realizes that a child with whom he has developed a friendship may or may not exist.<ref name="allmovie_bio" />

After his death in 2014, four films starring Williams were released: ''[[Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb]]'', ''[[A Merry Friggin' Christmas]]'', ''[[Boulevard (2014 film)|Boulevard]]'', and ''[[Absolutely Anything]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://downriversundaytimes.com/2014/08/24/celebrity-extra-265|title=Celebrity Extra|last=Elavsky|first=Cindy|publisher=[[King Features]]|date=August 24, 2014|work = Downriver Sunday Times}}</ref>

President [[Barack Obama]] released a statement upon Williams' death:
{{cquote|Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan, and everything in between. But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien—but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit. He made us laugh. He made us cry. He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most—from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets.

==Influences==

Williams credited comedians including [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[Nichols and May]], and [[Lenny Bruce]] as influences, admiring their ability to attract a more intellectual audience with a higher level of wit.<ref name="Nachman" />{{rp|43}} He also liked [[Jay Leno]] for his quickness in ad-libbing comedy routines and [[Sid Caesar]], whose acts he felt were "precious".<ref name="Grobel" />

Jonathan Winters was his "idol" early in life; Williams, aged eight, first saw him on television and paid him homage in interviews throughout his career.<ref name="Nachman" />{{rp|259}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/jonathan-winters-dead_n_3070474.html|title=Jonathan Winters Dead: 'Mork and Mindy' Star Dies At Age 87|date=April 12, 2013|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}</ref> Williams was inspired by Winters' ingenuity, realizing, he said, "that anything is possible, that anything is funny{{nbsp}}... He gave me the idea that it can be free-form, that you can go in and out of things pretty easily."<ref name="Nachman" />{{rp|260}}

During an interview in [[London]] in 2002, Williams told [[Michael Parkinson]] that Peter Sellers was an important influence, especially his multi-character roles in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', stating, "It doesn't get better than that." British comedy actors [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Peter Cook]] were also among his influences, he told Parkinson.<ref>video: {{cite interview|last=Williams|first=Robin|interviewer=[[Michael Parkinson]]|title=Robin Williams, Parkinson interview 2002|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LaJDOD5cJI|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}</ref>

Williams was also influenced by [[Richard Pryor]]'s fearless ability to talk about his personal life on stage, with subjects including his use of drugs and alcohol, and Williams added those kinds of topics during his own performances. By bringing up such personal matters as a form of comedy, he told Parkinson, it was "cheaper than therapy" and gave him a way to release his pent-up energy and emotions.<ref name="Nachman" />{{rp|121}}

Although Williams was first recognized as a stand-up comedian and television star, he later became known for acting in film roles of substance and serious drama. He was considered a "national treasure" by many in the entertainment industry and by the public.<ref name=Grobel/><ref>[https://www.showbiz411.com/2014/08/13/glenn-close-on-friend-and-colleague-robin-williams-was-a-world-treasure "Glenn Close on Friend and Colleague: 'Robin Williams Was a World Treasure'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525045202/http://www.showbiz411.com/2014/08/13/glenn-close-on-friend-and-colleague-robin-williams-was-a-world-treasure |date=May 25, 2017 }}, ''Showbiz411'', August 13, 2014</ref>

His on-stage energy and improvisational skill became a model for a new generation of stand-up comedians. Many comedians valued the way he worked highly personal issues into his comedy routines, especially his honesty about drug and alcohol addiction, along with depression.<ref name=CSM>[http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2014/0812/Robin-Williams-His-unscripted-riffs-were-not-merely-funny-but-observant-video "Robin Williams: His unscripted riffs were not merely funny, but observant"],(+video), ''Christian Science Monitor'', August 12, 2014</ref> According to media scholar Derek A. Burrill, because of the openness with which Williams spoke about his own life, "probably the most important contribution he made to pop culture, across so many different media, was as Robin Williams the person."<ref name=CSM/>

Williams created a signature free-form comedy persona so widely and uniquely identified that new comedians like [[Jim Carrey]] impersonated ''him'',<ref>{{YouTube|9zorOqE0j1c|"Jim Carrey Impersonates Robin Williams"}}</ref> paving the way for the growing comedy scene which developed in San Francisco. Young comedians felt more liberated on stage by seeing his spontaneously diverse range: "one moment acting as a bright, mischievous child, then as a wise philosopher or alien from outer space."<ref>Rappoport, Leon. ''Punchlines: The Case for Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Humor'', Greenwood Publishing (2005) p. 136</ref> According to [[Judd Apatow]], the eclectic performer's rapid-fire improvisational style was an inspiration as well as an influence for other comedians, but his talent was so extremely unusual no one else could possibly attempt to copy it.<ref name="Browne">{{cite journal | last=Browne |first=David |title=Robin Williams, 1951–2014 | journal=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=September 11, 2014 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/robin-williams-final-days-inside-rolling-stones-new-issue-20140827 | pages=38–47 | accessdate=August 26, 2016}}</ref>

His film performances often influenced other actors, both in and out of the film industry. Director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], who directed Williams in ''Mrs. Doubtfire'', says watching him work "was a magical and special privilege. His performances were unlike anything any of us had ever seen, they came from some spiritual and otherworldly place."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.vindy.com/news/2014/aug/13/chris-columbus-speaks-about-life-with-ro/?print|title = Valley native Chris Columbus speaks about life with Robin Williams|date = August 13, 2014|accessdate = October 24, 2014|website = vindy.com}}</ref> Looking over most of his filmography, Alyssa Rosenberg at ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was "struck by the breadth" and radical diversity of most of his roles, writing that "Williams helped us grow up."<ref name="WP"/>
