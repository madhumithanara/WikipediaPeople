''Queen'' received generally favorable reviews, though some critics took issue with the album's length and lyrical content. Mosi Reeves of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that ''Queen'' "brings a new Nicki Minaj character: the regal, haughty monarch, a woman who insists on sword-sharpened rhymes as a prerogative for excellence", however noted it to have "a flabby, meandering mid-section". In a mixed review, Bryan Rolli of ''[[Forbes]]'' concluded that ''Queen'' is "a great 10-song album hiding inside a messy 19-song album", though complimented Minaj's lyricism, and said the album "gives fans plenty to sink their teeth into".<ref name="Forbes">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/08/10/nicki-minaj-queen-album-review/|title=First Listen: Nicki Minaj's 'Queen' Is A Great 10-Song Album Hiding Inside A Messy 19-Song Album|last=Rolli|first=Bryan|date=August 10, 2018|work=Forbes|accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> For ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Chris Richards said, "''Queen'' only feels connected to the current rap zeitgeist in the saddest way — as another portrait of a visionary rapper in decline [...] A great Nicki Minaj comeback album would be the first great Nicki Minaj album, period."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/will-nicki-minaj-ever-release-an-album-thats-as-good-as-she-is/2018/08/13/d21b4ae4-9f13-11e8-83d2-70203b8d7b44_story.html?noredirect=on |title=Will Nicki Minaj ever release an album that's as good as she is? |last=Richards |first=Chris |date=August 13, 2018 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}</ref>

Minaj is known for her animated rapping style and her unique [[Flow (music)|flow]].

The alter egos are incorporated with her lyrics in British accents (Roman Zolanski) or soft-spokenness (Harajuku Barbie). [[Ice-T]] said about Minaj's rapping style, "[Minaj] does her thing.
