[[File:Cena FU Animated.gif|thumb|upright=1.18|Cena performing his finishing move, a [[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|fireman's carry slam]] known as the ''Attitude Adjustment'', on [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]]]
Cena's original gimmick was portraying a white rapper who wore jerseys, backwards hats, and a chain with a padlock around his neck, was known as the "Doctor of Thuganomics". First as ''"The Prototype"'', and later under his real name, Cena sometimes used underhanded tactics to score victories, such as using his chain as a weapon behind the referee's back.<ref name="news_John">{{Cite web | title = John Cena's embarrassing beginning | author =  | work = NewsComAu | date = April 11, 2016 | accessdate = July 13, 2018 | url = https://www.news.com.au/sport/more-sports/john-cena-began-career-horribly-as-the-prototype/news-story/b89ddb936c5f1e5fb548c9bc05e1171d | language =   | quote =  }}</ref> Cena often rapped before his matches, insulting his opponents, events that happened in the media and even the crowd. Cena also regularly performed "[[rap battles]]", where he and his opponent took turns rapping on each other. Cena has reverted to this persona twice: during his feud with The Rock in 2012, and again at WrestleMania&nbsp;35 in 2019 during a confrontation with Elias. In 2006, shortly after his first debut film, ''The Marine'', his wrestling character shifted from that of a rapper to a young military upstart, wearing dog tags and cargo shorts to the ring and also performing a salute to the crowd. Cena said in a 2011 interview with WWE.com that "every night when I do that salute, it's also a sign of respect to the men and women that don the uniform of the Armed Forces."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/tributetothetroops/story-behind-cena-salute|title=The story behind John Cena's salute|work=WWE|first=Bobby|last=Melok|date=December 16, 2011|accessdate=January 14, 2019}}</ref>

During WWE's change from TV-14 to TV-PG in mid-2008, the name of Cena's finishing move, the ''[[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|FU]]'', was changed to the ''Attitude Adjustment'' and his finishing submission move, the ''STFU'', was renamed the ''STF'' to fit with the WWE's new policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/artman/publish/WWE/article1004487.shtml|title=John Cena says it was his call to change his finishing move name, predicts that three wrestlers will be WWE stars|website=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|date=February 5, 2009|accessdate=July 23, 2018}}</ref> During his career, he has been known for ending his matches with a sequence of moves, dubbed the "[[five moves of doom|Five Moves of Doom]]". The moves typically go in the following order: flying shoulder block, sit-out hip toss, protobomb, ''Five Knuckle Shuffle'', and ''Attitude Adjustment''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/grantland-dictionary-pro-wrestling-edition/|title=Grantland Dictionary: Pro Wrestling Edition|first=David|last=Shoemaker|date=August 13, 2014|website=grantland.com}}</ref> During the summer of 2018, Cena promoted a sixth move.

Cena has portrayed a heroic character throughout his WWE career, except for a villainous run in 2002–2003. His signature ring gear includes jean shorts, sneakers, wristbands, and armbands. He also wears a variety of T-shirts and baseball caps, which commonly include one of his catchphrases: "Never Give Up", "You Can't See Me", "Hustle, Loyalty, Respect", and "Respect.
