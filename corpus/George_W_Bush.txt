{{George W. Bush series}}
'''George Walker Bush''' (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician and businessman who served as the 43rd [[president of the United States]] from 2001 to 2009. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he had previously served as the 46th [[governor of Texas]] from 1995 to 2000. Born into the [[Bush family]], his father, [[George H. W. Bush]], served as the 41st president of the United States from 1989 to 1993.

Bush is the eldest son of [[Barbara Bush|Barbara]] and George H. W. Bush, and the second son to become the American president after his father. He flew warplanes in the [[Texas Air National Guard|Texas]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]]. After graduating from Yale College in 1968 and [[Harvard Business School]] in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. Bush married [[Laura Welch]] in 1977 and unsuccessfully ran for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] baseball team before defeating [[Ann Richards]] in the [[1994 Texas gubernatorial election]]. As governor, Bush successfully sponsored legislation for tort reform, increased education funding, set higher standards for schools, and reformed the [[criminal justice]] system. Bush also helped make [[Wind power in Texas|Texas the leading producer]] of [[wind power in the United States|wind powered electricity in the United States]]. Bush was elected president of the United States in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] when he defeated Democratic incumbent Vice President [[Al Gore]] after a narrow and contested win that involved a [[Bush v. Gore|Supreme Court decision]] to stop a [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|recount in Florida]]. He became the fourth person to be elected president [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|without a popular vote victory]].

Upon taking office, Bush pushed through a $1.3 trillion [[Bush tax cuts|tax cut program]] and the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], a major education bill. He also pushed for [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] efforts, such as the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] and [[White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives|faith-based welfare initiatives]]. In response to the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]], Bush created the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] and launched a "[[War on Terror]]" that began with the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] in 2001. He also signed into law the controversial [[Patriot Act]] in order to authorize surveillance of suspected terrorists. In 2003, Bush ordered an [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], with the administration arguing that the [[Saddam Hussein]] regime possessed an active [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) program, and that the Iraqi government posed a threat to the United States. Some administration officials falsely claimed that Hussein had an operational relationship with Al-Qaeda, the perpetrators of the 9/11 attack. No stockpiles of WMDs or an active WMD program were ever found in Iraq. Bush also passed the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare Modernization Act]],  which created [[Medicare Part D]], and funding for the [[AIDS]] relief program known as [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|PEPFAR]]. 

In the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]] presidential race, Bush defeated Democratic Senator [[John Kerry]] in a close election. During his second term, Bush reached multiple [[free trade agreement]]s and successfully nominated [[John G. Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]] to the Supreme Court. He sought major changes to [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and immigration laws, but both efforts failed. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continued, and in 2007 he launched a [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of troops in Iraq]]. Bush received [[Public image of George W.

Bush was among the most popular, as well as unpopular, U.S. presidents in history; he received the highest recorded approval ratings in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, but one of the lowest such ratings during the [[2008 financial crisis]].<ref name="Gallup">{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/106426/Bush-Job-Approval-28-Lowest-Administration.aspx|title=Bush Job Approval at 28%, Lowest of His Administration|last=Newport|first=Frank|date=April 11, 2008|website=|publisher=Gallup|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702202556/http://www.gallup.com/poll/106426/Bush-Job-Approval-28-Lowest-Administration.aspx|archivedate=July 2, 2009|accessdate=January 20, 2009}}</ref> Bush finished his second term in office in 2009 and returned to Texas.

Incumbent Democratic president [[Bill Clinton]] was in his second and final term, and the field for nomination in both parties was wide open. Bush was the Governor of Texas in June 1999 when he announced his candidacy for president, joining [[John McCain]], [[Alan Keyes]], [[Steve Forbes]], [[Gary Bauer]], [[Orrin Hatch]], [[Elizabeth Dole]], [[Dan Quayle]], [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Lamar Alexander]], [[John Kasich]], and [[Bob Smith (New Hampshire politician)|Bob Smith]].

Bush portrayed himself as a [[compassionate conservatism|compassionate conservative]], implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the military, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.<ref name=msn/> By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.<ref name=msn/>

Bush won the [[Iowa caucuses]], and although he was heavily favored to win the [[New Hampshire primary]], he trailed McCain by 19&nbsp;percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum effectively became the front runner after the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|South Carolina primary]], which—according to ''[[The Boston Globe]]''—made history for his campaign's negativity. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as a [[smear campaign]].<ref name=anatomy>{{cite news |url=https://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/ |title=The anatomy of a smear campaign |work=The Boston Globe |last=Davis |first=Richard H. |date=March 21, 2004 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/ |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hook |first1=Janet |author2=Michael Finnegan |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/17/nation/na-mccain17 |title=McCain loses some of his rebel edge |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/17/nation/na-mccain17 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/us/politics/19mccain.html |title=Confronting Ghosts of 2000 in South Carolina |work=The New York Times |date=October 19, 2007 |accessdate=April 14, 2013 |last=Steinhauer |first=Jennifer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209070019/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/us/politics/19mccain.html |archivedate=December 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers when he selected [[Dick Cheney]]—a former [[White House Chief of Staff]], Congressman and Secretary of Defense—to be his running mate. At the time, Cheney was serving as head of Bush's vice presidential search committee. Soon after at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]], Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party.

Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas.<ref name=msn/> During his campaign, Bush criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President [[Al Gore]], over [[Gun law in the United States|gun control]] and taxation.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Sack, Kevin |author2=Toner, Robin |date=August 13, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/13/us/2000-campaign-record-congress-gore-selected-issues-ready-for-prime-time.html |title=The 2000 Campaign: The Record; In Congress, Gore Selected Issues Ready for Prime Time |work=The New York Times |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/13/us/2000-campaign-record-congress-gore-selected-issues-ready-for-prime-time.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

When the election returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|recount]].<ref name="msn"/> The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html George W.

The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator [[John Kerry]]. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the [[Iraq War]], and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq,<ref name=msn/> and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.

Following the resignation of CIA director [[George Tenet]] in 2004, Bush nominated [[Porter Goss]] to head the agency. The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration.<ref name="salon">{{cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2004/11/15/cia_13/|title=Purging the disloyal at the CIA|last1=Sealey|first1=Geraldine|date=November 15, 2004|newspaper=Salon|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> After Goss' appointment, many of the CIA's senior agents were fired or quit.

In the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]].

Bush undertook a number of educational agendas, such as increasing the funding for the [[National Science Foundation]] and [[National Institutes of Health]] in his first years of office and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students.

After being re-elected, Bush signed into law a [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] drug benefit program that, according to [[Jan Crawford]], resulted in "the greatest expansion in America's [[welfare state]] in forty years" – the bill's costs approached $7&nbsp;trillion.<ref name="greenburg" />{{Rp|274}} In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress.

====Social services and Social Security====
Following Republican efforts to pass the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare Act of 2003]], Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncpssm.org/pdf/PL108summary.pdf |title=Summary of Medicare Act of 2003 |accessdate=August 20, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724191249/http://www.ncpssm.org/pdf/PL108summary.pdf |archive-date=July 24, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The retired persons lobby group [[AARP]] worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement.

In his [[2008 State of the Union Address]], Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2&nbsp;billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, "Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive." He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, "This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/stateoftheunion2008.htm |title=George W.

Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviser [[Karen Hughes]] to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/freedomagenda/|title=Freedom Agenda|last=|first=|date=|website=George W.

In March 2006, Bush reversed decades of U.S. policy when he visited the Republic of India in a trip focused particularly on areas of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], counter-terrorism co-operation; and discussions that would eventually lead to the [[India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-03-02-nuclear-pact_x.htm |title=Nuclear deal announced as Bush visits India |newspaper=USA Today |date=March 2, 2006 |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060302-5.html |title=U.S. –India Joint Statement |date=March 2, 2006 |publisher=The White House |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611161845/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060302-5.html |archivedate=June 11, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This was in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Bill Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests has been characterized as "sanctions and hectoring".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29825.html |title=Roemer key to U.S. –India relationship&nbsp;– Daniel Libit and Laura Rozen |publisher=Politico.Com |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126182109/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29825.html |archivedate=November 26, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20, 2001, Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks. He specifically thanked [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] for traveling to Washington to show "unity of purpose with America", and said "America has no truer friend than Great Britain."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People |last=Bush |first=George W. |publisher=[[The White House]] |date=September 20, 2001 |accessdate=April 6, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527194111/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |archivedate=May 27, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the [[Oval Office]], promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. Three days after the attacks, Bush visited [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] and met with Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. To much applause, Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing in a heap of rubble: "I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you.

On October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of [[Northern Alliance]] troops in [[Kabul]] on November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat the [[Taliban]], drive [[al-Qaeda]] out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated,<ref name=taliband>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/11/world/nation-challenged-military-campaign-taliban-defeated-pentagon-asserts-but-war.html |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |date=December 11, 2001 |author1=Shanker, Tom |author2=Eric Schmitt |newspaper=The New York Times |title=A Nation Challenged; Military Campaign; Taliban Defeated, Pentagon Asserts, but War Goes On |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/11/world/nation-challenged-military-campaign-taliban-defeated-pentagon-asserts-but-war.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.<ref name=taliband/> Later that month the UN had installed the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] chaired by [[Hamid Karzai]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/isaf.cfm |title=Fact Sheet: International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan |publisher=[[Center for Defense Information]] |date=February 14, 2002 |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/isaf.cfm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm |title=More Dutch troops for Afghanistan |publisher=BBC News |date=February 3, 2006 |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Efforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of [[Tora Bora]], which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/12/AR2006061200843.html |title=U.S. Concludes bin Laden Escaped at Tora Bora Fight |accessdate=September 6, 2015 |date=April 17, 2002 |work=The Washington Post |first1=Barton |last1=Gellman |first2=Thomas E. |last2=Ricks}}</ref> It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces under the Obama administration.

Beginning with his January 29, 2002 [[State of the Union]] address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an "[[axis of evil]]" allied with terrorists and posing "a grave and growing danger" to U.S. interests through possession of [[weapons of mass destruction]].<ref name=sotu2002/><ref>{{cite web |title=Iraq: The War Card |url=http://www.iwatchnews.org/accountability/iraq-war-card |publisher=The Center for Public Integrity |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://www.iwatchnews.org/accountability/iraq-war-card |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In January 2010, at President Obama's request, Bush and Bill Clinton established the [[Clinton Bush Haiti Fund]] to raise contributions for relief and recovery efforts following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] earlier that month.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/01/16/haiti.earthquake/ |title=Hillary Clinton meets with Haiti leader after arrival |date=January 17, 2010 |accessdate=January 11, 2011 |publisher=CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119083558/http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/01/16/haiti.earthquake/ |archivedate=January 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Over the years, President Bush has had a good-natured friendship with [[Michelle Obama]]. "President Bush and I, we are forever seatmates because of protocol, and that's how we sit at all the official functions," Mrs. Obama told the ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today Show]]''. "He's my partner in crime at every major thing where all the 'formers' gather. So we're together all the time." She later added, "I love him to death. He's a wonderful man, he's a funny man."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/politics/a22979284/george-w-bush-michelle-obama-friendship-history/|title=George W.

President Bush's legacy continues to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring in the U.S. after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as [[PEPFAR]]. Critics often point to his handling of the [[Iraq War]], specifically the failure to find [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of [[Taxation in the United States|tax policy]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[climate change]] and the [[2008 financial crisis]]—as proof that George W.

Several historians and commentators hold that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history.
