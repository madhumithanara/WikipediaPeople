{{Clint Eastwood series}}
'''Clinton Eastwood Jr.''' (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor, film director, and producer. After achieving success in the [[Western (genre)|Western]] TV series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', he rose to international fame with his role as the "[[Man with No Name]]" in [[Sergio Leone]]'s [[Dollars Trilogy|''Dollars'' Trilogy]] of [[Spaghetti Western]]s during the mid-1960s, and as [[antihero]] cop [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in the five ''[[Dirty Harry (film series)|Dirty Harry]]'' films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring [[cultural icon]] of [[masculinity]].<ref name="Fischer, Landy & Smith">Fischer, Landy & Smith, p. 43.</ref><ref>Kitses, p. 307.</ref>

An Academy Award nominee for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], Eastwood won [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] for his Western film ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992) and his sports drama ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' (2004). His greatest commercial successes are the adventure comedy ''[[Every Which Way but Loose]]'' (1978) and its action comedy sequel, ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'' (1980).<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Clint Eastwood movie box office results|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=clinteastwood.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=January 17, 2014|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|comment=}}</ref> Other popular Eastwood films include the Westerns ''[[Hang 'Em High]]'' (1968) and ''[[Pale Rider]]'' (1985), the prison film ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' (1979), the war film ''[[Heartbreak Ridge]]'' (1986), the action film ''[[In the Line of Fire]]'' (1993), and the romantic drama ''[[The Bridges of Madison County (film)|The Bridges of Madison County]]'' (1995). More recent works are ''[[Gran Torino]]'' (2008) and ''[[The Mule (2018 film)|The Mule]]'' (2018). From 1967 to 2020, Eastwood's company [[Malpaso Productions]] has produced all but four of his American films.

In addition to directing many of his own [[star vehicle]]s, Eastwood has also directed films in which he did not appear, such as the mystery drama ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'' (2003) and the war film ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'' (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations, the drama ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]'' (2008), and the biographical sports drama ''[[Invictus (film)|Invictus]]'' (2009). The war drama biopic ''[[American Sniper]]'' (2014) set box-office records for the largest January release ever and was also the largest opening ever for an Eastwood film.

Elected in 1986, Eastwood served for two years as the mayor of [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]]. In 2000, Eastwood received the Italian [[Venice Film Festival]]'s [[Golden Lion]] award, honoring his lifetime achievements. Bestowed two of France's highest civilian honors, he received in 1994 the [[Commander]] of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]], and in 2007 the [[Legion of Honour]] medal.

[[file:Clint Eastwood Nina Foch Rawhide 1959.jpg|thumb|upright|Eastwood alongside [[Nina Foch]] in an episode of ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', 1959]]
According to a CBS press release for ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', the [[Universal Studios|Universal-International]] film company was shooting in Fort Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director,<ref name="McGilligan52">McGilligan, p. 52</ref> although this is disputed by Eastwood's unauthorized biographer, Patrick McGilligan.<ref name="McG53">McGilligan, p. 53</ref> According to Eastwood's official biography, the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood.<ref name="McGilligan52" /> While in Los Angeles, Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak him into a Universal studio, where he introduced him to cameraman [[Irving Glassberg]].<ref name="McGilligan52" /> Glassberg arranged for an audition under [[Arthur Lubin]], who, although very impressed with Eastwood's appearance and stature, then 6'4" (193&nbsp;cm), disapproved of his acting, remarking, "He was quite amateurish. He didn't know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything".<ref name="McGilligan60">McGilligan, p. 60</ref>  Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood's initial contract in April 1954, at $100 per week.<ref name="McGilligan60" /> After signing, Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth, a lifelong trademark.<ref>McGilligan, p. 62</ref>

In May 1954, Eastwood made his first real audition for ''[[Six Bridges to Cross]]'' but was rejected by [[Joseph Pevney]].<ref name="McGilligan63">McGilligan, p. 63</ref> After many unsuccessful auditions, he was eventually given a minor role by director [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]] in ''[[Revenge of the Creature]]'' (1955), a sequel to the recently released ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''.<ref name="McGilligan64">McGilligan, p. 64</ref> In September 1954, Eastwood worked for three weeks on Arthur Lubin's ''[[Lady Godiva of Coventry]]'', won a role in February 1955, playing "Jonesy", a sailor in ''[[Francis in the Navy]]'' and appeared uncredited in another Jack Arnold film, ''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]'', where he played a squadron pilot.<ref>Fitzgerald & Magers, p. 264</ref><ref>McGilligan, p. 80</ref> In May 1955, Eastwood put four hours' work into the film ''[[Never Say Goodbye (1956 film)|Never Say Goodbye]]'' and had a minor uncredited role as a ranch hand (his first western film) in August 1955 with ''Law Man'', also known as ''[[Star in the Dust]]''.<ref name="McGilligan81">McGilligan, p. 81</ref> Universal presented him with his first television role on July 2, 1955, on [[NBC]]'s ''Allen in Movieland'', which starred comedian [[Steve Allen]], actor [[Tony Curtis]] and swing musician [[Benny Goodman]].<ref name="McGilligan86">McGilligan, p. 86</ref> Although he continued to develop as an actor, Universal terminated his contract on October 23, 1955.<ref name="Eliot36">Eliot, p. 36</ref>

Eastwood was cast as Tom in ''[[Star in the Dust]]'' (1956) with [[Richard Boone]]. He joined the Marsh Agency, and although Lubin landed him his biggest role to date in ''[[The First Traveling Saleslady]]'' (1956) and later hired him for ''[[Escapade in Japan]]'' (1957), without a formal contract Eastwood was struggling.<ref name="McGilligan85">McGilligan, p. 85</ref> On his financial advisor [[Irving Leonard (financial adviser)|Irving Leonard]]'s advice, he switched to the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957.

[[file:Eastwood Publicity Still 1960s.jpg|thumb|upright|Eastwood in the 1960s]]
In late 1963, Eastwood's ''Rawhide'' co-star [[Eric Fleming]] rejected an offer to star in an Italian-made western called ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964), filmed in a remote region of Spain by a relatively unknown director, [[Sergio Leone]].<ref name="McG126">McGilligan, p. 126</ref> [[Richard Harrison (actor)|Richard Harrison]] suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his ''Rawhide'' image. He signed a contract for $15,000 in wages for eleven weeks' work, with a bonus of a [[Mercedes-Benz]] automobile upon completion.<ref name="Eliot59">Eliot, p. 59</ref><ref name="McG128">McGilligan, p. 128</ref> Eastwood later said of the transition from a TV western to ''A Fistful of Dollars'': "In ''Rawhide'' I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I decided it was time to be an antihero."<ref>Hughes, p. 4</ref> Eastwood was instrumental in creating the [[Man with No Name]] character's distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the "mask" he was attempting to create for the character.<ref name="McG131">McGilligan, p. 131</ref>

''A Fistful of Dollars'' proved a landmark in the development of [[Spaghetti Western]]s, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy<ref>Mercer, p. 272</ref> and he was rehired to star in ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter [[Luciano Vincenzoni]], the rights to ''For a Few Dollars More'' and the trilogy's final film, ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), were sold to [[United Artists]] for about $900,000.<ref name="McG148">McGilligan, p. 148</ref>

In January 1966, Eastwood met producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] in New York City and agreed to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production, ''[[The Witches (1967 film)|The Witches]]'' (''Le Streghe'', 1967), opposite De Laurentiis's wife, [[Silvana Mangano]].<ref name="McG150">McGilligan, p. 150</ref> Eastwood's 19-minute installment took only a few days to shoot, but his performance did not please critics; one wrote, "no other performance of his is quite so 'un-Clintlike'."<ref name="McG151">McGilligan, p. 151</ref> Two months later Eastwood began work on ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', again playing the mysterious Man with No Name. [[Lee Van Cleef]] returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with [[Eli Wallach]] portraying the Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of [[Confederate gold]] buried in a cemetery. During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up, Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop. "I know about these things," he said. "Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can."<ref name="McG156">McGillagan, p. 156</ref> Minutes later confusion among the crew over the word "Vaya!" resulted in a premature explosion that could have killed Wallach.<ref name="McG156" />

Stardom brought Eastwood more roles.

Before ''Hang 'Em High'''s release, Eastwood had already begun working on ''[[Coogan's Bluff (film)|Coogan's Bluff]]'' (1968), about an Arizona deputy sheriff tracking a wanted psychopathic criminal ([[Don Stroud]]) through New York City.

=== 1970s ===
Eastwood starred with [[Shirley MacLaine]] in the western ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' (1970), directed by Don Siegel.

Eastwood's career reached a turning point in 1971.<ref name="McG196">McGilligan, p. 196</ref> Before Irving Leonard died, he and Eastwood had discussed the idea of Malpaso producing ''[[Play Misty for Me]]'', a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired, and his debut as a director.<ref name="McGilligan192">McGilligan, p. 192</ref> The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave (Eastwood), who has a casual affair with Evelyn ([[Jessica Walter]]), a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night, asking him to play her favorite song – [[Erroll Garner]]'s "[[Misty (song)|Misty]]".

Following [[Sean Connery]]'s announcement that he would not play [[James Bond]] again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down because he believed the character should be played by an English actor.<ref>{{cite news |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |title=Clint Eastwood as Superman or James Bond?

Eastwood's first western as director was ''[[High Plains Drifter]]'' (1973), in which he also starred. The film had a moral and supernatural theme, later emulated in ''Pale Rider''. The plot follows a mysterious stranger (Eastwood) who arrives in a brooding Western town where the people hire him to protect them against three soon-to-be-released felons. There remains confusion during the film as to whether the stranger is the brother of the deputy, whom the felons lynched and murdered, or his ghost. Holes in the plot were filled with black humor and [[allegory]], influenced by Leone.<ref name="McG221">McGilligan, p. 221</ref> The revisionist film received a mixed reception, but was a major box-office success. A number of critics thought Eastwood's directing was "as derivative as it was expressive," with [[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] of the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' remarking that Eastwood had "absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society."<ref name="McG223">McGilligan, p. 223</ref> [[John Wayne]], who had declined a role in the film, sent a letter to Eastwood soon after the film's release in which he complained that, "The townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer, the spirit that made America great."<ref>Schickel, p. 291</ref>

[[File:Clint Eastwood-Holden-Breezy.jpg|thumb|left|Directing [[William Holden]] in ''Breezy'' (1973)]]
Eastwood next turned his attention towards ''[[Breezy]]'' (1973), a film about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met [[Sondra Locke]] for the first time, an actress who would play major roles in six of his films over the next ten years and would become an important figure in his life.<ref name="McG229">McGilligan, p. 229</ref> [[Kay Lenz]] got the part of Breezy because Locke, at age 29, was nearly twice the character's age.

Once filming of ''Breezy'' had finished, Warners announced that Eastwood had agreed to reprise his role as Callahan in ''[[Magnum Force]]'' (1973), a sequel to ''Dirty Harry'', about a group of rogue young officers (among them [[David Soul]], [[Robert Urich]] and [[Tim Matheson]]) in the San Francisco Police Department who systematically exterminate the city's worst criminals.<ref name="McG233">McGilligan, p. 233</ref> Although the film was a major success after release, grossing $58.1&nbsp;million in the United States (a record for Eastwood), it was not a critical success.<ref name="Eliot153">Eliot, p. 153</ref><ref name="McG236">McGilligan, p. 236</ref> ''The New York Times'' critic [[Nora Sayre]] panned the often contradictory moral themes of the film, while the paper's [[Frank Rich]] called it "the same old stuff".<ref name="McG236" />

Eastwood teamed up with [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[George Kennedy]] in the buddy action caper ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'' (1974), a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high suspense and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4&nbsp;million.<ref name="McG241">McGilligan, p. 241</ref> Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. Eastwood reportedly fumed at the lack of Academy Award recognition for him and swore that he would never work for United Artists again.<ref name="McG241" /><ref name="McG240">McGilligan, p. 240</ref>

[[File:Film shoot for The Eiger Sanction in Zurich (10).jpg|thumb|right|At a film shoot for ''The Eiger Sanction'' (1975)]]
Eastwood's next film ''[[The Eiger Sanction (film)|The Eiger Sanction]]'' (1975) was based on [[Trevanian]]'s [[The Eiger Sanction|critically acclaimed spy novel]] of the same name. Eastwood plays Jonathan Hemlock in a role originally intended for [[Paul Newman]], an assassin turned college art professor who decides to return to his former profession for one last "sanction" in return for a rare [[Pissarro]] painting. In the process he must climb the north face of the [[Eiger]] in Switzerland under perilous conditions. [[Mike Hoover]] taught Eastwood how to climb during several weeks of preparation at [[Yosemite]] in the summer of 1974 before filming commenced in [[Grindelwald]], Switzerland on August 12, 1974.<ref>Schickel, p. 314</ref><ref name="McG244">McGilligan, p. 244</ref> Despite prior warnings about the perils of the Eiger the film crew suffered a number of accidents, including one fatality.<ref>Schickel, p. 315</ref><ref>Zmijewsky, p. 176</ref> Despite the danger, Eastwood insisted on doing all his own climbing and stunts.

''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), a western inspired by [[Asa Carter]]'s 1972&nbsp;novel of the same name,<ref name="McG257">McGilligan, p. 257</ref> has lead character Josey Wales (Eastwood) as a pro-Confederate guerrilla who refuses to surrender his arms after the [[American Civil War]] and is chased across the old southwest by a group of enforcers. The supporting cast included Locke as his love interest and [[Chief Dan George]] as an elderly [[Cherokee]] who strikes up a friendship with Wales. Director [[Philip Kaufman]] was fired by producer Bob Daley under Eastwood's command, resulting in a fine reported to be around $60,000 from the [[Directors Guild of America]]{{snd}}who subsequently passed new legislation reserving the right to impose a major fine on a producer for discharging and replacing a director.<ref name="McG264">McGilligan, p. 264</ref> The film was pre-screened at the [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]] Center for the Arts and Humanities in [[Idaho]] during a six-day conference entitled ''Western Movies: Myths and Images''. Invited to the screening were a number of esteemed film critics, including Jay Cocks and Arthur Knight; directors such as [[King Vidor]], [[William Wyler]], and [[Howard Hawks]]; and a number of academics.<ref name="McG266">McGilligan, p. 266</ref> Upon release in the summer of 1976 ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'' was widely acclaimed, with many critics and viewers seeing Eastwood's role as an iconic one that related to America's ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War.<ref name="McG266" /> [[Roger Ebert]] compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwood's portrayal of Josey Wales with his Man with No Name character in the ''Dollars'' westerns and praised the film's atmosphere.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19760101/REVIEWS/601010306/1023 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=The Outlaw Josey Wales |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=January 1, 1976 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116002157/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19760101%2FREVIEWS%2F601010306%2F1023 |archivedate=January 16, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film would later appear in ''Time''{{'s}} "Top 10 Films of the Year".<ref name="McGilligan267">McGilligan, p. 267</ref>

Eastwood was then offered the role of [[Benjamin L.

The film had Callahan partnered with a new female officer ([[Tyne Daly]]) to face a San Francisco Bay area group resembling the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. The film, culminating in a shootout on [[Alcatraz]] island, was considerably shorter than the previous ''Dirty Harry'' films at 95{{nbsp}}minutes,<ref name="McG273">McGilligan, p. 273</ref> but was a major commercial success grossing $100&nbsp;million worldwide to become Eastwood's highest-grossing film to date.<ref name="McG278">McGilligan, p. 278</ref>

Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[The Gauntlet (film)|The Gauntlet]]'' (1977) opposite Locke, Pat Hingle, [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]], [[Bill McKinney]], and [[Mara Corday]]. In this film, he portrays a down-and-out cop assigned to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify against the [[organized crime|mob]]. Although a moderate hit with the viewing public, critics had mixed feelings about the film, with many believing it was overly violent. Ebert, in contrast, gave the film three stars and called it "classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny."<ref>{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19770101/REVIEWS/701010304/1023 |title=The Gauntlet |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=January 1, 1977 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612184015/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19770101%2FREVIEWS%2F701010304%2F1023 |archivedate=June 12, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> In ''[[Every Which Way but Loose]]'' (1978) he has an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role. His character, Philo Beddoe, is a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a lost love (Locke) accompanied by his best friend, Orville Boggs (played by [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]]) and an [[orangutan]] called Clyde. The film proved surprisingly successful upon its release and became Eastwood's most commercially successful film up to that time. Panned by critics, it ranked high among the box-office successes of his career and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1978.<ref name="McG302">McGilligan, p. 302</ref>

Eastwood starred in ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' (1979), the last of his films directed by Siegel. It was based on the true story of [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Lee Morris]] who, along with [[John Anglin (criminal)|John]] and [[Clarence Anglin]], escaped from the notorious [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] in 1962. The film was a major success; [[Stanley Kauffmann]] of ''[[The New Republic]]'' praised it as "crystalline cinema"<ref>McGilligan, p. 307</ref> and Frank Rich of ''Time'' described it as "cool, cinematic grace".<ref>Zmijewsky, p. 213</ref>

=== 1980s ===
Eastwood directed and played the title role in ''[[Bronco Billy]]'' (1980), alongside Locke, [[Scatman Crothers]], and [[Sam Bottoms]].<ref>McGilligan, p. 317</ref> Eastwood has cited ''Bronco Billy'' as being one of the most relaxed shoots of his career and biographer [[Richard Schickel]] argued that Bronco Billy is Eastwood's most self-referential character.<ref>Schickel, p. 362</ref><ref>Schickel, p. 365</ref> The film was a commercial disappointment,<ref name="Maslin 1280">{{cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Maslin |title=Any Which Way You Can (1980): Screen: Clint and Clyde |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E03E7DB1339F934A25751C1A966948260 |work=The New York Times |date=December 17, 1980 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101175543/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E03E7DB1339F934A25751C1A966948260 |archivedate=November 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref> but was liked by critics.

[[File:Eastwood1981.jpg|thumb|upright=0.73|right|Eastwood in 1981]]
Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[Honkytonk Man]]'' (1982), based on the eponymous [[Clancy Carlile]]'s [[Great Depression|depression-era]] novel. Eastwood portrays a struggling western singer Red Stovall who suffers from [[tuberculosis]], but has finally been given an opportunity to make it big at the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. He is accompanied by his young nephew (played by real-life son [[Kyle Eastwood|Kyle]]) to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he is supposed to record a song. Only ''Time'' gave the film a good review in the United States, with most reviewers criticizing its blend of muted humor and tragedy.<ref>Schickel, p. 383</ref> Nevertheless, the film received a more positive reception in France, where it was compared to [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'',<ref>Schickel, p. 384</ref> and it has since acquired the very high rating of 93{{nbsp}}percent on Rotten Tomatoes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/honkytonk_man |title=Honkytonk Man (1982) |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=May 1, 2011}}</ref> Around the same time, Eastwood directed, produced, and starred in the [[Cold War]]-themed ''[[Firefox (film)|Firefox]]'' (also 1982). Based on a 1977 [[Firefox (novel)|novel with the same name]] written by [[Craig Thomas (author)|Craig Thomas]], the film was shot before but released after ''Honkytonk Man''. Russian filming locations were not possible due to the Cold War, and the film had to be shot in [[Vienna]] and other locations in Austria to simulate many of the Eurasian story locations. With a production cost of $20&nbsp;million, it was Eastwood's highest budget film to that time.<ref name="Schickel378">Schickel, p. 378</ref> ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' magazine likened Eastwood's performance to "[[Luke Skywalker]] trapped in Dirty Harry's Soul".<ref name="Schickel378" />

Eastwood directed and starred in the fourth ''Dirty Harry'' film, ''[[Sudden Impact]]'', which was shot in the spring and summer of 1983 and released that December. It is considered the darkest and most violent of the series.<ref>Zmijewsky and Pfeiffer, p. 232</ref> By this time, Eastwood received 60&nbsp;percent of all profits from films he starred in and directed, with the rest going to the studio.<ref>Munn, p. 194</ref> ''Sudden Impact'' was his final on-screen collaboration with Locke. She plays an artist who, along with her sister, was gang-raped a decade before the story takes place and seeks revenge for her sister's now-vegetative state by systematically murdering the rapists. The line "[[Go ahead, make my day]]" (uttered by Eastwood during an early scene in a coffee shop) has been cited as one of cinema's immortal lines. It was quoted by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in a speech to Congress, and used during the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential elections]].<ref>Smith, p. 100</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/quotes100.pdf |title=Frankly, My Dear, I Don't Give A Damn |publisher=[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313150615/http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/quotes100.pdf |archivedate=March 13, 2011 |url-status=dead  |access-date=March 8, 2011}}</ref><ref>Rogin, p. 7</ref> The film was the second most commercially successful of the ''Dirty Harry'' films, after ''The Enforcer'', earning $70&nbsp;million.

''[[Tightrope (film)|Tightrope]]'' (1984) had Eastwood starring opposite [[Geneviève Bujold]] in a provocative thriller, inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in [[New Orleans]] to avoid confusion with the ''Dirty Harry'' films,<ref>Schickel, p. 389</ref> Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target's tortured psychology and fascination for [[sadomasochism]].<ref>McGilligan, p. 361</ref> ''Tightrope'' was a critical and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] film of 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tightrope.htm |title=Tightrope (1984) |website=Box Office Mojo |date=October 23, 1984 |accessdate=July 23, 2013}}</ref> Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy ''[[City Heat]]'' (also 1984) alongside [[Burt Reynolds]], a film about an ex-cop turned private eye and his former police lieutenant partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the [[Prohibition era]] of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50&nbsp;million domestically, but was overshadowed by [[Eddie Murphy]]'s ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''.<ref>Schickel, p. 400</ref>

Eastwood made his only foray into TV direction with the ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'' episode ''Vanessa in the Garden'' (1985), which starred [[Harvey Keitel]] and Locke as a married couple. This was his first collaboration with [[Steven Spielberg]], who later co-produced ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'' and ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Halbfinger |first=David M. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/movies/21flag.html |title=The Power of an Image Drives Film by Eastwood |work=The New York Times |date=September 21, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402230455/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/movies/21flag.html |archivedate=April 2, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref> He would revisit the Western genre when he directed and starred in ''[[Pale Rider]]'' (1985), a film based on the classic western ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953) and follows a preacher descending from the mists of the Sierras to side with the miners during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1850.<ref>McGilligan, p. 371</ref> The title is a reference to the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], as the rider of the pale horse is Death, and shows similarities to Eastwood's western ''High Plains Drifter'' (1973) in its themes of morality and justice as well as its exploration of the supernatural.<ref>McGilligan, p. 375</ref> It was hailed as one of the best films of 1985 and the best western to appear for a considerable period, with [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' remarking, "This year (1985) will go down in film history as the moment Clint Eastwood finally earned respect as an artist".<ref>McGilligan, p. 378</ref>

Eastwood co-starred with [[Marsha Mason]] in the military drama ''[[Heartbreak Ridge]]'' (1986), about the 1983&nbsp;United States [[invasion of Grenada]]. He portrays a [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Gunnery Sergeant]] veteran of the [[Korean War]] and Vietnam War who realizes he is nearing the end of his military service. Production and filming were marred by internal disagreements between Eastwood and long-time friend and producer Fritz Manes, as well as between Eastwood and the [[United States Department of Defense]] who expressed contempt for the film.<ref name="McG398">McGilligan, p. 398</ref><ref>McGilligan, p. 406</ref> At the time, the film was a commercial rather than a critical success, and has only come to be viewed more favorably in recent times.<ref>Schickel, p. 421</ref> The film grossed $70&nbsp;million domestically.<ref>McGilligan, p. 407</ref>

Eastwood starred in ''[[The Dead Pool]]'' (1988), the fifth and final film in the ''Dirty Harry'' series. It co-starred [[Patricia Clarkson]], [[Liam Neeson]], and a young [[Jim Carrey]] who plays Johnny Squares, a drug-addled rock star and the first of the victims on a list of celebrities drawn up by horror film director Peter Swan (Neeson) who are deemed most likely to die, the so-called "Dead Pool". The list is stolen by an obsessed fan who, in mimicking his favorite director, makes his way through the list killing off celebrities, of which Dirty Harry is also included. ''The Dead Pool'' grossed nearly $38&nbsp;million, relatively low receipts for a ''Dirty Harry'' film. It is generally viewed as the weakest film of the series, though Roger Ebert thought it was as good as the original.<ref name="The Film journal">{{cite book |title=The Film journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hAnsAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=May 1, 2011 |date=1988 |publisher=Pubsun Corp. |page=24}}</ref><ref name="Ebert1992">{{cite book |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Roger Ebert's movie home companion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTshz3206kYC |accessdate=May 1, 2011 |year=1992 |publisher=Andrews and McMeel |isbn=978-0-8362-6243-8}}</ref>

Eastwood began working on smaller, more personal projects and experienced a lull in his career between 1988 and 1992. Always interested in jazz, he directed ''[[Bird (1988 film)|Bird]]'' (1988), a biopic starring [[Forest Whitaker]] as jazz musician [[Charlie Parker|Charlie "Bird" Parker]]. Alto saxophonist [[Jackie McLean]] and [[Spike Lee]], son of jazz bassist [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill Lee]] and a long time critic of Eastwood, criticized the characterization of Charlie Parker remarking that it did not capture his true essence and sense of humor.<ref name="McG433">McGilligan, p. 433</ref> Eastwood received two [[Golden Globes]] for the film, the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for his lifelong contribution, and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director award]]. However, ''Bird'' was a commercial failure, earning just $11&nbsp;million, which Eastwood attributed to the declining interest in jazz among black people.<ref>Schickel, p. 435</ref> Carrey would appear with Eastwood again in the poorly-received comedy ''[[Pink Cadillac (film)|Pink Cadillac]]'' (1989). The film is about a [[bounty hunter]] and a group of white supremacists chasing an innocent woman ([[Bernadette Peters]]) who tries to outrun everyone in her husband's prized pink [[Cadillac]]. The film failed both critically and commercially,<ref>Schickel, p. 442</ref> earning barely more than ''Bird'' and marking a low point in Eastwood's career.<ref>McGilligan, p. 437</ref>

=== 1990s ===
Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[White Hunter Black Heart]]'' (1990), an adaptation of [[Peter Viertel]]'s ''[[roman à clef]]'', about [[John Huston]] and the making of the classic film ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]''. Shot on location in [[Zimbabwe]] in the summer of 1989,<ref>McGilligan, p. 452</ref> the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just $8.4&nbsp;million.<ref name="McG461">McGilligan, p. 461</ref> Eastwood directed and co-starred with [[Charlie Sheen]] in ''[[The Rookie (1990 film)|The Rookie]]'', a [[buddy cop]] action film released in December 1990.

Eastwood revisited the western genre in ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992), a film which he directed and starred in as an aging ex-[[gunfighting|gunfighter]] long past his prime. Scripts existed for the film as early as 1976 under titles such as ''The Cut-Whore Killings'' and ''The William Munny Killings'' but Eastwood delayed the project because he wanted to wait until he was old enough to play his character and to savor it as the last of his western films.<ref name="McG467" /> ''Unforgiven'' was a major commercial and critical success; Jack Methews of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described it as "the finest classical western to come along since perhaps John Ford's 1956 ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''.<ref name="McG473">McGilligan, p. 473</ref> The film was nominated for nine [[Academy Award]]s,<ref>McGilligan, p. 475</ref> (including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Eastwood and Best Original Screenplay for [[David Webb Peoples]]) and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Eastwood.

=== Directing ===
Beginning with the thriller ''Play Misty for Me'', Eastwood has directed over 30 films, including Westerns, action films, and dramas. He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director. ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s [[David Denby]] wrote that, unlike Eastwood,<ref name="denby20100308">{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/08/100308fa_fact_denby?currentPage=all |title=Out of the West |work=The New Yorker |date=March 8, 2010 |accessdate=September 1, 2012 |author=Denby, David}}</ref>

{{quote|quote=John Ford appeared in just a few silent films; Howard Hawks never acted in movies. Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, James Stewart, Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, Steve McQueen, and Sean Connery never directed a feature. John Wayne directed only twice, and badly; ditto Burt Lancaster. Paul Newman, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, Robert De Niro, and Sean Penn have directed a few movies each, with mixed commercial and artistic success.}}

From the very early days of his career Eastwood was frustrated by directors' insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected, and when he began directing in 1970, he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result, Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets. He usually avoids actors' rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take.<ref>Munn, p. 160</ref><ref name="Biskind19697">Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 196–97 (interviewer Peter Biskind)</ref> Eastwood's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of [[Woody Allen]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and the [[Coen brothers]]. When acting in others' films he sometimes takes over directing, such as for ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'', if he believes production is too slow.{{r|denby20100308}} In preparation for filming Eastwood rarely uses [[storyboard]]s for developing the layout of a shooting schedule.<ref name="Gentry65">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 65 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref><ref name="Abb173">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 173 (interviewer Denise Abbott)</ref><ref name="Pascal235">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 235 (interviewer [[Pascal Mérigeau]])</ref> He also attempts to reduce script background details on characters to allow the audience to become more involved in the film,<ref name="Intp678">Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 67–68 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref> considering their imagination a requirement for a film that connects with viewers.<ref name="Intp678" /><ref name="Intp91">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 91 (interviewer David Thomson)</ref> Eastwood has indicated that he lays out a film's plot to provide the audience with necessary details, but not "so much that it insults their intelligence."<ref name="Intp60">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 60 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref>

According to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, "Eastwood's style is to shoot first and act afterward. He etches his characters virtually without words. He has developed the art of underplaying to the point that anyone around him who so much as flinches looks hammily histrionic."<ref name="Inc1971">{{cite book |last=Fayard |first=Judy |work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |title=Who can stand 32,580 seconds of Clint Eastwood? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44 |accessdate=March 8, 2011 |date=July 23, 1971 |page=46 |issn=0024-3019}}</ref> Interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter commented that Eastwood's films are "superbly paced: unhurried; cool; and [give] a strong sense of real time, regardless of the speed of the narrative"<ref name="Intp45">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 45 (interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter)</ref> while Ric Gentry considers Eastwood's pacing "unrushed and relaxed."<ref name="Intp71">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 71 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref> Eastwood is fond of low-key lighting and back-lighting to give his films a [[Film noir|"noir-ish"]] feel.<ref name="Biskind19697" /><ref name="Milan143">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 143 (interviewer Milan Pavolić)</ref>

Eastwood's frequent exploration of ethical values has drawn the attention of scholars, who have explored Eastwood's work from ethical and theological perspectives, including his portrayal of justice, mercy, suicide and the angel of death.<ref>Sara Anson Vaux (2012).

=== Spiritual beliefs ===
In 1973, Eastwood told the film critic [[Gene Siskel]], "No, I don't believe in God."<ref>Gene Siskel, "Clint: The Cynical King who Outdrew the Duke," ''Chicago Tribune'', January 7, 1973.</ref> Eastwood has said that he finds spirituality in nature (as suggested by his Western, ''Pale Rider'', 1985), stating that "I was born during the Depression and I was brought up with no specific church. We moved every four or five months during the first 14 years of my life, so I was sent to a different church depending on wherever we lived. Most of them were [[Protestant]], but I went to other churches because my parents wanted me to try to figure out things for myself. They always said, 'I just want to expose you to some religious order and see if that's something you like'. So although my religious training was not really specific, I do feel spiritual things. If I stand on the side of the Grand Canyon and look down, it moves me in some way."<ref name=2011showbiz />

"Of course, it would be wonderful to talk with my parents again, who are, of course, deceased. It makes the idea of death much less scary. But then again, if you think that nothing happens after you die, maybe it makes you live life better. Maybe you're supposed to do the best you can by the gift you're given of life and that alone."<ref name=2011showbiz>{{cite web |url=http://www.showbizspy.com/article/228386/clint-eastwood-on-the-fence-about-god-director-clint-eastwood-discusses-his-religious-beliefs.html |title=Clint Eastwood on The Fence About God!

Eastwood has been conscious of his health and fitness since he was a teenager, and practices healthful eating habits. As a young man making a name for himself during the production of ''Rawhide'', Eastwood would be featured in magazines and journals, which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In the August 1959 edition of ''TV Guide'', for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, to take vitamins, and to avoid sugar-loaded beverages, excessive alcohol, and overloading on carbohydrates.<ref name="McGilligan, p. 108" />

On July 21, 1970, Eastwood's father died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 64.<ref name="McGilligan192" /> The death, described by Fritz Manes as "the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life", came as a shock to Eastwood, since his grandfather had lived to be 92. It had a profound impact on Eastwood's life; from then on he became more productive, working with a greater sense of urgency and with more speed and efficiency on set.<ref name="McGilligan193" /> Although Eastwood had always been a health and fitness enthusiast, he became more so after his father's death. He abstained from hard liquor, adopted a more rigorous health regimen, and sought to stay fit.<ref name="McGilligan193" /> However, he still favored cold beer and opened a pub called the Hog's Breath Inn in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel-by-the-Sea]] in 1971.<ref name="McGilligan204" /> Eastwood eventually sold the pub and now owns the Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant, also located in Carmel-by-the-Sea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.missionranchcarmel.com/ |title=Welcome to Mission Ranch |publisher=Missionranchcarmel.com |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref>

Eastwood is an [[audiophile]] and owns an extensive collection of [[LP album|LPs]] which he plays on a Rockport [[Phonograph|turntable]]. He has had a strong passion for music all his life, particularly jazz and country and western music.<ref name="McGilligan114">McGilligan, p. 114</ref> He dabbled in music early on by developing as a boogie-woogie pianist and had originally intended to pursue a career in music by studying for a music theory degree after graduating from high school. In late 1959 he produced the album ''Cowboy Favorites'', released on the [[Cameo-Parkway Records|Cameo]] label,<ref name="McGilligan114" /> which included some classics such as [[Bob Wills]]'s "[[New San Antonio Rose|San Antonio Rose]]" and [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[Don't Fence Me In (song)|Don't Fence Me In]]". Despite his attempts to plug the album by going on a tour, it never reached the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="McGilligan114" /> In 1963, Cameo producer [[Kal Mann]] told him that "he would never make it big as a singer".<ref name="McGilligan115">McGilligan, p. 115</ref> Nevertheless, during the off season of filming ''Rawhide'', Eastwood and [[Paul Brinegar]]{{snd}}sometimes joined by [[Sheb Wooley]]{{snd}}toured rodeos, state fairs, and festivals. In 1962, their act, entitled Amusement Business Cavalcade of Fairs, earned them as much as $15,000 a performance.<ref name="McGilligan115" /> Eastwood has his own [[Warner Bros. Records]]-distributed imprint, Malpaso Records, as part of his deal with Warner Brothers. This deal was unchanged when [[Warner Music Group]] was sold by Time Warner to private investors.<ref name=krall /> Malpaso Records, which has released all of the scores of Eastwood's films from ''The Bridges of Madison County'' onward, has also released the album of a 1996 jazz concert he hosted, titled ''Eastwood after Hours – Live at Carnegie Hall''.

Eastwood favors [[jazz]] (especially [[bebop]]), [[blues]], classic [[rhythm and blues]], classical, and country-and-western music; his favorite musicians include saxophonists [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Lester Young]], pianists [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Dave Brubeck]], and [[Fats Waller]], and [[Delta blues]]man [[Robert Johnson]].<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Nick |last=Tosches |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/12/eastwood200812 |title=Nick Tosches on Clint Eastwood |magazine=Vanity Fair |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref> He is also a pianist and composer.<ref name="McGilligan114" /> Jazz has played an important role in Eastwood's life from a young age and, although he never made it as a professional musician, he passed on the influence to his son [[Kyle Eastwood]], a jazz bassist and composer.

Eastwood composed the [[film score]]s of ''Mystic River'', ''Million Dollar Baby'', ''Flags of Our Fathers'', ''[[Grace Is Gone]]'', ''Changeling'', ''Hereafter'', ''J.
