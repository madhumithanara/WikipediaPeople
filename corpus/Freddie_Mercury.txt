'''Freddie Mercury'''<!--Mercury legally changed his name. He is listed in death and probate records as 'Frederick Mercury'.--> (born '''Farrokh Bulsara'''; 5 September 1946&nbsp;– 24 November 1991)<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica2">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Freddie-Mercury|title=Freddie Mercury, British singer and songwriter|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|access-date=11 June 2015}}</ref> was a British singer, songwriter<!--[[MOS:BIO]] – Nationality: the country of which the person was a citizen when the person became notable. Mercury, as is noted throughout the article, became notable as a British citizen/singer-->, record producer, and lead vocalist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Regarded as one of the greatest lead singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-[[octave]] [[vocal range]]. Mercury defied the conventions of a [[Rock music|rock]] frontman, with his highly theatrical style influencing the artistic direction of Queen.

Born in 1946 in [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|Zanzibar]] to [[Parsi people|Parsi-Indian]] parents, he attended English-style boarding schools in India from the age of eight and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled the [[Zanzibar Revolution]], moving to [[Middlesex]], England. Having studied and written music for years, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]]. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including "[[Killer Queen]]", "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", "[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]", "[[We Are the Champions]]", "[[Don't Stop Me Now]]", and "[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert. He also led a solo career and served as a producer and guest musician for other artists.

Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. He confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the disease, having been diagnosed in 1987. Mercury had continued to record with Queen following his diagnosis, and he was posthumously featured on the band’s final album, ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995). In 1992, [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|his tribute concert]] was held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. His career with Queen was dramatised in the biopic ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]]'' (2018).

As a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2003, and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. In 1990, he and the other Queen members were awarded the [[Brit Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and one year after his death Mercury was awarded it individually.<!--This is what text says in article below--> In 2005, Queen were awarded an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]]. In 2002, Mercury ranked number 58 in the [[BBC]]'s poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].

Despite the reservations of the other members and [[Trident Studios]], the band's initial management, Mercury chose the name "Queen" for the new band.

[[The Who]] lead singer [[Roger Daltrey]] described Mercury as "the best virtuoso rock 'n' roll singer of all time. He could sing anything in any style. He could change his style from line to line and, God, that's an art. And he was brilliant at it."<ref>O'Donnell, Jim (2013). ''Queen Magic: Freddie Mercury Tribute and Brian May Interview''.

The most notable aspect of his songwriting involved the wide range of genres that he used, which included, among other styles, [[rockabilly]], [[progressive rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[disco]]. As he explained in a 1986 interview, "I hate doing the same thing again and again and again. I like to see what's happening now in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things."<ref name = "Wenner_2001"/> Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, "Bohemian Rhapsody" is non-cyclical in structure and comprises dozens of [[chord (music)|chords]].<ref name = "Queen_1992"/><ref name="Aledort_2003"/> He also wrote six songs from ''[[Queen II]]'' which deal with multiple key changes and complex material.

===Instrumentalist===
[[File:Queen 1984 012.jpg|thumb|right|Mercury playing rhythm guitar during a Queen concert in Frankfurt, Germany, 1984]]
As a young boy in India, Mercury received formal piano training up to the age of nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-oriented: his favourite artists at the time were [[the Who]], [[the Beatles]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Led Zeppelin]]. He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments and from the early 1980s began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlisted [[Fred Mandel]] (a Canadian musician who also worked for [[Pink Floyd]], [[Elton John]], and [[Supertramp]]) for his first solo project. From 1982 Mercury collaborated with Morgan Fisher (who performed with Queen in concert during the Hot Space leg),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenconcerts.com/live/queen.html|title=QUEEN CONCERTS – Complete Queen live concertography|last=Mr.Scully|website=www.queenconcerts.com|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref> and from 1985 onward Mercury collaborated with [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] (in the studio) and [[Spike Edney]] (in concert).<ref name="LesleyJones"/>

Mercury played the piano in many of Queen's most popular songs, including "[[Killer Queen]]", "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", "[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]", "[[We Are the Champions]]", "[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]", and "[[Don't Stop Me Now]]". He used concert [[grand piano]]s (such as a [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] on "Bohemian Rhapsody") and, occasionally, other keyboard instruments such as the [[harpsichord]]. From 1980 onward, he also made frequent use of synthesisers in the studio. Queen guitarist Brian May claims that Mercury was unimpressed with his own abilities at the piano and used the instrument less over time because he wanted to walk around on stage and entertain the audience.<ref name = "Longfellow_2006"/><ref name="Independent 5 Things">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/freddie-mercury-death-anniversary-25-years-queen-things-you-may-not-know-a7436266.html|title=Freddie Mercury 25th anniversary: 5 things you may not know about the Queen legend|date=24 November 2016|first=Roisin|last=O'Connor|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> Although he wrote many lines for the guitar, Mercury possessed only rudimentary skills on the instrument.

===Solo career===
{{See also|The Solo Collection}}
As well as his work with Queen, Mercury put out two solo albums and several singles. Although his solo work was not as commercially successful as most Queen albums, the two off-Queen albums and several of the singles debuted in the top 10 of the [[UK Music Charts]]. His first solo effort goes back to 1972 under the pseudonym '''Larry Lurex''', when [[Trident Studios]]' house engineer Robin Geoffrey Cable was working in a musical project, at the time when Queen were recording their debut album; Cable enlisted Mercury to perform lead vocals on the songs "[[I Can Hear Music]]" and "[[Goin' Back]]", both were released together as a single in 1973.<ref name="lurex" /> Eleven years later, Mercury contributed to the [[Richard Wolf|Richard "Wolfie" Wolf]] remix of the song [[Love Kills (Freddie Mercury song)|"Love Kills"]], used as the end title theme for [[National Lampoon, Incorporated|National Lampoon]]'s ''[[Loaded Weapon 1]]''. The song was originally recorded in 1984, when it was included on the soundtrack for the restoration of the 1927 [[Fritz Lang]] film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. First written by [[Giorgio Moroder]] in collaboration with Mercury, and produced by Moroder and [[Reinhold Mack|Mack]], "Love Kills" debuted at the number 10 position in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name = "ReesCrampton_1999_809"/> Mack also produced the 1987 single "Hold On", which Mercury recorded with actress Jo Dare for the German action drama ''Zabou''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Zabou-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/release/814203?lang_update=1|title=Zabou (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|publisher=discogs.com|accessdate=24 November 2016}}</ref>

Mercury's two full albums outside the band were ''[[Mr. Bad Guy]]'' (1985) and ''[[Barcelona (Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballé album)|Barcelona]]'' (1988).<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/> His first album, ''Mr. Bad Guy'', debuted in the top ten of the [[UK Album Charts]].<ref name = "ReesCrampton_1999_809"/> In 1993, a remix of "[[Living on My Own]]", a single from the album, [[List of posthumous number ones on the UK Singles Chart|posthumously reached number one]] on the [[UK Singles Charts]].

His second album, ''Barcelona'', recorded with Spanish [[soprano]] vocalist [[Montserrat Caballé]], combines elements of popular music and opera. Many critics were uncertain what to make of the album; one referred to it as "the most bizarre CD of the year".<ref name="Bradley_1992"/> The album was a commercial success,<ref>Larkin, Colin (1998) ''The encyclopedia of popular music: Louvin, Charlie – Paul, Clarence, Volume 5''.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
[[File:Freddie house.JPG|thumb|right|upright|12 Stafford Terrace in [[Kensington]], London, one of Mercury's former homes]]
In the early 1970s, Mercury had a long-term relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. He lived with Austin for several years in [[West Kensington]], London. By the mid-1970s, he had begun an affair with David Minns, an American record executive at [[Elektra Records]]. In December 1976, Mercury told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship.<ref name="LesleyJones">{{harvnb|Jones|2011|p=3, Ch. 7, Mary}}</ref><ref name="Teckman_2004_part2"/> Mercury moved out of the flat they shared, and bought Austin a place of her own nearby his new address of 12 Stafford Terrace, Kensington. While the Stafford Terrace apartment was undergoing renovations, Mercury lived with Minns in Dovehouse Street, [[Chelsea, London]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Evans | first1 = David | last2= Minns | first2= David | title = THIS WAS THE REAL LIFE: The Tale of Freddie Mercury | publisher = Tusitala Press | edition = Kindle | date = 29 March 2015 | isbn = 9781783016358 }}</ref>

Mercury and Austin remained friends through the years, with Mercury often referring to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, Mercury said of Austin, "All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary [Austin], but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary, and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my [[common-law marriage|common-law wife]]. To me, it was a marriage.

Radio disc jockey [[Kenny Everett]] met Mercury in 1974, when he invited the singer onto his [[Capital London]] [[breakfast show]].<ref name="Everett"/> As two of Britain's most flamboyant, outrageous, and popular entertainers, they shared much in common and became close friends.<ref name="Everett"/>

In 1975, Mercury visited Everett, bringing with him an advance copy of the single "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]".<ref name="Jackson2011"/> Despite doubting that any station would play the six-minute track, Everett placed the song on the turntable, and, after hearing it, exclaimed: "Forget it, it's going to be number one for centuries".<ref name="Jackson2011"/> Although [[Capital Radio]] had not officially accepted the song, Everett talked incessantly about a record he possessed but could not play. He then frequently proceeded to play the track with the excuse: "Oops, my finger must've slipped."<ref name="Jackson2011"/> On one occasion, Everett aired the song thirty-six times in a single day. Capital's switchboard was overwhelmed with callers inquiring when the song would be released.<ref name="Everett"/><ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/kenny-everett--the-best-possible-way-to-remember-a-true-pioneer-8191316.html | title = Kenny Everett – The best possible way to remember a true pioneer | newspaper = The Independent | accessdate = 19 January 2015| date = 30 September 2012 }}</ref>

During the 1970s, Everett became advisor and mentor to Mercury and Mercury served as Everett's confidante.<ref name="Everett"/> Throughout the early- to mid-1980s, they continued to explore their homosexuality and experiment with drugs. Although they were never lovers, they did experience London nightlife together.<ref name="Everett"/> By 1985, they had fallen out, and their friendship was further strained when Everett was outed in the autobiography of his ex-wife [[Lee Everett Alkin|Lady Lee]].<ref name="Everett"/> In 1989, with their health failing, Mercury and Everett were reconciled.<ref name="Everett">"When Freddie Mercury Met Kenny Everett" (1 June 2002).

===Sexual orientation===
While some commentators claimed Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public,<ref name="Januszczak_1996"/><ref name="Cain_2006" /><ref name="Landesman_2006"/> others claimed he was "openly [[homosexuality|gay]]".<ref name="Fitzpatrick_2006"/><ref name="BBC_2006"/> In December 1974, when asked directly, "So how about being bent?" by the ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'', Mercury replied, "You're a crafty cow. Let's put it this way: there were times when I was young and green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had my share of schoolboy pranks. I'm not going to elaborate further."<ref>{{cite news |first=Joe|last=Sommerlad|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/bohemian-rhapsody-oscars-2019-rami-malek-backlash-controversy-freddie-mercury-queen-a8740806.html |title=Bohemian Rhapsody: Why the Oscar-nominated Queen biopic has suffered a backlash |date=22 January 2019|accessdate=7 March 2019 |work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England}}</ref> Homosexual acts between adult males over the age of 21 had been [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|decriminalised in the United Kingdom in 1967]], seven years earlier.

During his career, Mercury's flamboyant stage performances sometimes led journalists to allude to his sexuality. Dave Dickson, reviewing Queen's performance at [[Wembley Arena]] in 1984 for ''[[Kerrang!]]'', noted Mercury's "[[Camp (style)|camp]]" addresses to the audience and even described him as a "posing, pouting, posturing tart".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.queencuttings.com/dblog/articolo.asp?articolo=310 | title= Kerrang! – UK – Queen, Wembley Arena London | work=Queen Cuttings | accessdate=29 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007065922/http://www.queencuttings.com/images/80s/WembleyArena_05sept1984_rev.jpg|archivedate= 7 October 2007}}</ref> In 1992, John Marshall of ''[[Gay Times]]'' opined: "[Mercury] was a 'scene-queen,' not afraid to publicly express his gayness, but unwilling to analyse or justify his 'lifestyle' […] It was as if Freddie Mercury was saying to the world, 'I am what I am.

===Personality===
Although he cultivated a flamboyant stage personality, Mercury was shy and retiring when not performing, particularly around people he did not know well,<ref name="O'Donnell_2005"/><ref name = "Cain_2006"/> and granted very few interviews. Mercury once said of himself: "When I'm performing I'm an [[extrovert]], yet inside I'm a completely different man."<ref name="Myers_1991"/> On this contrast to "his larger-than-life stage persona", BBC music broadcaster [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]] adds he was "lovely, bright, sensitive, and quite vulnerable."<ref name="Harris"/> While on stage, Mercury basked in the love from his audience. Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s suicide note mentions how he admired and envied the way Mercury "seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd".<ref name="RSBestSingers">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/rolling-stone-readers-pick-the-best-lead-singers-of-all-time-20110412/2-freddie-mercury-0762142 | work = Readers Pick the Best Lead Singers of All Time | title = 2.

Mercury never discussed his ethnic or religious background with journalists. The closest he came to doing so was in response to a question about his outlandish persona, he said, "that’s something inbred, it's a part of me. I will always walk around like a Persian popinjay",<ref name="Chapman">{{cite book |last1=Chapman |first1=Ian |title=Global Glam and Popular Music: Style and Spectacle from the 1970s to the 2000s |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |pages=86, 87}}</ref> an oblique reference to his Indian Parsi background. Feeling a connection to Britain prior to arriving in England, the young Bulsara was heavily influenced by British fashion and music trends while growing up.<ref name="Chapman"/> According to his longtime assistant Peter Freestone, "if Freddie had his way, he would have been born aged 18 in [[Feltham]]."<ref name="Chapman"/> Harris states, "One of the things about Freddie was that he was very civilised and quite ‘English’. I’d go over to his flat near [[Shepherd's Bush]] in the afternoon, and he’d get out the fine china and the sugar lumps and we’d have a cup of tea."<ref name="Harris">{{cite news |title=Bob Harris on Marc Bolan, David Bowie, Queen, Robert Plant and more... |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/bob-harris-on-marc-bolan-david-bowie-queen-robert-plant-and-more |accessdate=27 June 2020 |magazine=[[Metal Hammer|Louder Sound]]}}</ref>

When asked by ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1981 if rock stars should use their power to try to shape the world for the better, Mercury responded, "Leave that to the politicians. Certain people can do that kind of thing, but very few. [[John Lennon]] was one. Because of his status, he could do that kind of preaching and affect people's thoughts. But to do this you have to have a certain amount of intellect and magic together, and the John Lennons are few and far between.

Mercury cared for at least ten cats throughout his life, including: Tom, Jerry, Oscar, Tiffany, Dorothy, Delilah, Goliath, Miko, Romeo, and Lily. He was against the inbreeding of cats for specific features and all except for Tiffany and Lily, both given as gifts, were adopted from the [[Blue Cross (animal charity)|Blue Cross]]. Mercury "placed as much importance on these beloved animals as on any human life", and showed his adoration by having the artist Ann Ortman paint portraits of each of them.

In October 1986, the British press reported that Mercury had his blood tested for [[HIV/AIDS]] at a [[Harley Street]] clinic. A reporter for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', [[Hugh Whittow]], questioned Mercury about the story at [[Heathrow Airport]] as he was returning from Japan.

After the conclusion of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired to his home in [[Kensington]], West London.
