Born in [[West Reading, Pennsylvania]], Swift relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 2004 to pursue a career in [[country music]]. At age 14, she became the youngest artist signed by the [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing|Sony/ATV Music publishing house]], and at age 15, she signed her first record deal. Her 2006 [[Taylor Swift (album)|eponymous debut studio album]] was the longest-charting album of the 2000s on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Its third single, "[[Our Song (Taylor Swift song)|Our Song]]", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the ''Billboard'' [[Country Airplay]] chart. Swift's breakthrough second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008), won four [[Grammy Award]]s, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], and was certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. It yielded the crossover hit singles "[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]" and "[[You Belong with Me]]".

Swift's third studio album, ''[[Speak Now]]'' (2010), spawned the two-time Grammy Award-winning single "[[Mean (song)|Mean]]". Her cross-genre fourth studio album, ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012), earned Swift her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one single, "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]". Swift fully transitioned to [[pop music|pop]] music on her next studio album, ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014), which made her the first solo female artist to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year twice. The album included three ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one singles, "[[Shake It Off]]", "[[Blank Space]]", and "[[Bad Blood (Taylor Swift song)|Bad Blood]]". Preceded by her fifth U.S. number-one single "[[Look What You Made Me Do]]", Swift's [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]-inspired sixth studio album, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017), made her the first artist to have four albums each sell over one million copies in their opening week in the U.S. Its follow-up, ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019), was the world's best-selling studio album of 2019. Swift eschewed pop for [[indie folk]] and [[alternative rock]] on her eighth studio album, ''[[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|Folklore]]'' (2020). The album and its lead single, "[[Cardigan (song)|Cardigan]]", made Swift the first artist to have an album and a single debut at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 and Hot 100 simultaneously.
