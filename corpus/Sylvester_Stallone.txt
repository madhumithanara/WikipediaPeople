After his beginnings as a struggling actor for a number of years upon arriving to [[New York City]] in 1969 and later [[Hollywood]] in 1974, he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role as Stanley Rosiello in ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/lords-of-flatbush/|title=45 Years Ago: 'The Lords of Flatbush' Introduces Rocky and Fonzie|first=Michael|last=Christopher|website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref>

Stallone mostly only found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizeable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor, starting in 1976 with his self-created role as the boxer [[Rocky Balboa]], in the first film of the successful [[Rocky (film series)|''Rocky'' series]] (1976–2018). In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog boxer that fights numerous brutal opponents, and wins the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight championship]] twice. The last two entries in the series are  ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' and ''[[Creed II]]'', that serve as spin-off films focusing on [[Donnie Creed|Adonis "Donnie" Creed]], the son of the ill-fated boxer [[Apollo Creed]], to whom the long retired Rocky is a mentor. Reprising the role during the 2010s brought Stallone praise, and his first [[Golden Globe]] award for the first ''Creed'', as well as a third [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/golden-globes/2016/01/12/golden-globes-sylvester-stallone-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-apology/|title=Sylvester Stallone says he owes 'Creed' team 'everything' after Globes omission|website=EW.com}}</ref>

Stallone had similar box-office success portraying the [[PTSD]]-plagued soldier [[John Rambo]] in the five [[Rambo (film series)|''Rambo'' films]] (1982–2019), and as mercenary [[List of characters from The Expendables film series#Barney Ross|Barney Ross]] in the three [[The Expendables (film series)|''The Expendables'' films]] (2010–2014).

He wrote or co-wrote most of the films in his three biggest franchises, and directed many of them.

Stallone's film ''[[Rocky]]'' was inducted into the [[National Film Registry]], and had its props placed in the [[Smithsonian Museum]]. His use of the front entrance to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in the ''Rocky'' series led the area to be nicknamed the [[Rocky Steps]], and [[Philadelphia]] has a statue of his Rocky character placed permanently near the museum. It was announced on December 7, 2010 that he was voted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in the non-participant category.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/pet-rock-1.811972/sylvester-stallone-hall-of-famer-1.2523881 |title=Sylvester Stallone, hall of famer |date=December 7, 2010 |work=Newsday |accessdate=December 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211122730/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/pet-rock-1.811972/sylvester-stallone-hall-of-famer-1.2523881 |archivedate=December 11, 2010 }}</ref>

In 1977, Stallone was nominated for two Academy Awards for ''Rocky'', for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. He became the third man in history to receive these two nominations for the same film, after [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Orson Welles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1977/memorable-moments|title=The 49th Academy Awards Memorable Moments|work=Oscars.org - Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|date=August 26, 2014}}</ref>

== Film career ==
=== Early roles to breakthrough: 1969–1976 ===
While Stallone was a student in [[Leysin]], [[Switzerland]], he had a brief uncredited role as a restaurant customer, in the sports drama, ''[[Downhill Racer]]'' (1969). He can be seen sitting at a table, near to stars [[Robert Redford]] and [[Camilla Sparv]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=stallone%20downhill%20racer%20facebook&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-ab&gfe_rd=cr&ei=czFaWJ-aDorW8AffmJfwBQ#q=stallone%20downhill%20racer%20uncredited|title=stallone downhill racer facebook - Google Search|publisher=|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK6IfWnyNWU|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Stallone had his first starring role in the [[softcore pornography]] feature film ''[[The Party at Kitty and Stud's]]'' (1970).

I read in a trade paper about this film [''The Party at Kitty and Studs'', 1970] that was paying {{US$|100}} a day—for a {{US$|100}} a day I would wreak havoc. Instead of doing something desperate, I worked for two days for {{US$|200}} and got myself out of the bus station."</ref> Stallone later explained that he had done the film out of desperation after being evicted from his apartment and finding himself homeless for several days. He has also said that he slept three weeks in the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] in New York City prior to seeing a casting notice for the film. In the actor's words, "it was either do that movie or rob someone, because I was at the end – the very end – of my rope".<ref>[http://www.playboy.com/arts-entertainment/features/sylvester-stallone/sylvester-stallone-04.html Sylvester Stallone interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606223229/http://www.playboy.com/arts-entertainment/features/sylvester-stallone/sylvester-stallone-04.html |date=June 6, 2011 }}, ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'', September 1978.</ref> The film was released several years later as ''Italian Stallion'', in order to cash in on Stallone's newfound fame (the new title was taken from Stallone's nickname since ''Rocky''). Stallone also starred in the erotic [[Off-Broadway]] stage play ''Score'' which ran for 23 performances at the Martinique Theatre from October 28 to November 15, 1971, and was later made into the 1974 film ''[[Score (1974 film)|Score]]'' by [[Radley Metzger]].<ref name="FM-Summer1997">{{citation|last=Gallagher|first=Steve|title=The Libertine|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/summer1997/metzger.php |date=Summer 1997|work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker Magazine]]|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}</ref>

After moving to New York City, Stallone shared a flat with his girlfriend, Sasha Czack, who supporting them by working as a waitress and she was an aspiring actress herself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1128921/sylvester-stallones-life-timeline/|title=Sylvester Stallone's taken more punches in life than he has on the big screen|first=Lauren|last=Kelly|date=October 11, 2016}}</ref> Stallone took odd jobs around this time, including being a cleaner at a zoo, and an usher, where he scalped tickets, but he was caught by the manager, and fired. Stallone apparently bathed wearing his clothes, and persisted with auditions, but never really got anywhere. He visited a local library, furthering his writing skills, and became interested in the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.looper.com/27729/truth-sylvester-stallone/|title=The truth about Sylvester Stallone|first=Brian|last=Boone|date=October 13, 2016|website=Looper.com}}</ref>

In 1972, Stallone was on the verge of giving up with acting, due to a lack of decent jobs. A personal disappointment was failing to earn himself a spot as an Italian extra in what was to become one of the most massive hits of 1972 – ''[[The Godfather]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/hollywood/sylvester-stallone-was-rejected-as-extra-in-the-godfather/|title=Sylvester Stallone was rejected as extra in 'The Godfather'|date=February 27, 2016}}</ref> He could not understand why he was rejected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.projectcasting.com/news/sylvester-stallone-the-godfather/|title=Stallone: I Was Turned Down for an Extra Role in 'The Godfather'|date=February 25, 2016}}</ref> Instead, he was relegated to a background role in another Hollywood hit; ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'', with [[Barbra Streisand]]. Stallone is hardly visible in his two appearances.

Stallone happened to be acting in a play that a friend invited him to partake in, and an agent in attendance thought that Stallone fit the role of Stanley, a main character in ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]]'', which had a start-stop schedule from 1972 to 1974 over budget issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/8347-REVIEW-THE-LORDS-OF-FLATBUSH-STARRING-SYLVESTER-STALLONE,-PERRY-KING,-and-HENRY-WINKLER-From-Sony-Pictures-Choice-Collection.html|title=REVIEW: "THE LORDS OF FLATBUSH" STARRING SYLVESTER STALLONE, PERRY KING, and HENRY WINKLER From Sony Pictures Choice Collection - Cinema Retro|website=cinemaretro.com}}</ref> Stallone, around mid-1973, achieved his first proper starring role, in the independent film ''[[No Place to Hide (1970 film)|No Place to Hide]]'', playing a man who is associated with a New York-based urban terrorist movement, with a jewellery-seller as his love interest. The film was re-cut and retitled ''Rebel'' years later, this second version featuring Stallone as its star. After the style of [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'', this film, in 1990, was re-edited from [[outtake]]s from the original movie and newly shot matching footage, then [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|redubbed]] into an award-winning parody of itself titled ''A Man Called... Rainbo''.

Stallone's other first few film roles were minor, and included brief uncredited appearances in ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970) as a soldier sitting at a table, ''[[Pigeons (film)|Pigeons]]'' (1970) as a party guest, [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971) as a subway thug, in the psychological thriller ''[[Klute]]'' (1971) as an extra dancing in a club, and in the [[Jack Lemmon]] film ''[[The Prisoner of Second Avenue]]'' (1975) as a youth. In the Lemmon film, Jack Lemmon's character chases, tackles and mugs Stallone, thinking that Stallone's character is a pickpocket. He had his second starring role in ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]]'', in 1974.<ref name=tca/> In 1975, he played supporting roles in ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely]]''; ''[[Capone (1975 film)|Capone]]''; and ''[[Death Race 2000]]''. He made guest appearances on the TV series ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'' and ''[[Kojak]]''. He is also supposedly in ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]''. It is often said that his scene was deleted.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-iFLCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA145&dq=stallone+mandingo+deleted#v=onepage|title=Thomas Hauser on Boxing: Another Year Inside the Sweet Science|first=Thomas|last=Hauser|date=December 10, 2014|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|isbn=9781557286673|via=Google Books}}</ref> However, some fans think he plays a man wearing a red hat in a scene where a slave is hanged.

Stallone gained worldwide fame with his starring role in the smash hit ''[[Rocky]]'' (1976).<ref name=tca/> On March 24, 1975, Stallone saw the [[Muhammad Ali]]–[[Chuck Wepner]] fight. That night Stallone went home, and after three days<ref>{{YouTube|S5bslRI4gFk|The Rocky Story by Sly Stallone}}</ref> and 20 straight hours,<ref name=tony-story>{{YouTube|_TC6jSRSElk|As told to Tony Robbins}}</ref> he had written the script, but Stallone subsequently denied that Wepner provided any inspiration for it.<ref name="ESPN Wepner Recognized">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/page/IamChuckWepner/chuck-wepner-recognized-rocky-fame |title='Real Rocky' Wepner finally getting due |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2012}}</ref><ref name="The Real Rocky">{{cite video | people=Feuerzeig, Jeff (Director) | date=October 25, 2011 | title=The Real Rocky | medium=Motion picture | publisher=ESPN Films}}</ref> Other possible inspirations for the film may have included [[Rocky Graziano]]'s autobiography ''Somebody Up There Likes Me'', and [[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|the movie of the same name]]. Wepner filed a lawsuit which was eventually settled with Stallone for an undisclosed amount.<ref name="The Real Rocky" /> Stallone attempted to sell the script to multiple studios, with the intention of playing the lead role himself. Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff became interested and offered Stallone {{US$|350,000}} for the rights, but had their own casting ideas for the lead role, including [[Robert Redford]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]. Stallone refused to sell unless he played the lead character and eventually, after a substantial budget cut to compromise, it was agreed he could be the star.<ref>{{cite book| last = Nelson| first= Murray R.| title = American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas [4 Volumes]: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas | date= May 23, 2013 | page= 1095}}</ref>

=== Subsequent success: 1977–1999 ===
[[File:Sylvester Stallone - 1977.jpg|thumb|upright|Stallone at the [[Ken Norton#Aftermath: Norton becomes champion|Ken Norton / Duane Bobick boxing match]] in 1977]]In 1977, at [[49th Academy Awards]] ''Rocky'' was nominated for ten [[Academy Award|Award]]s, including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] nominations for Stallone. The film went on to win the Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Directing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].

Following the success of ''Rocky'', Stallone made his directorial debut and starred in the 1978 film ''[[Paradise Alley]]'', a family drama in which he played one of three brothers who enter the world of [[wrestling]]. That same year, he starred in [[Norman Jewison]]'s ''[[F.I.S.T.]]'', a social drama in which he plays a warehouse worker, very loosely modelled on [[James Hoffa]], who becomes involved in the labor union leadership. In 1979 he wrote, directed and starred in the sequel to his 1976 hit, ''[[Rocky II]]'' (replacing [[John G. Avildsen]], who won an Academy Award for directing the first film), which also became a major success,<ref name=tca/> grossing {{US$|200}}&nbsp;million. In 1981, he starred alongside [[Michael Caine]] and soccer star [[Pelé]] in ''[[Escape to Victory]]'', a sports drama in which he plays a [[prisoner of war]] involved in a Nazi propaganda soccer game. That same year, he starred in the thriller ''[[Nighthawks (1981 film)|Nighthawks]]'', in which he plays a New York city cop who plays a cat-and-mouse game with a foreign terrorist, played by [[Rutger Hauer]].
Stallone launched another major franchise, starring as [[Vietnam-American War|Vietnam]] veteran [[John Rambo]], a former Green Beret, in the action film ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982),<ref name=tca/> which was both a critical and box office success. Critics praised Stallone's performance, saying he made Rambo seem human, as opposed to the way he is portrayed in the book of the same name. Four Rambo sequels, ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988), ''[[Rambo (2008 film)|Rambo]]'' (2008), and ''[[Rambo: Last Blood]]'' (2019) followed. He also continued his box office success with the ''Rocky'' franchise and wrote, directed, and starred in two more 1980s sequels to the series: ''[[Rocky III]]'' (1982) and ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985). Stallone has portrayed these two characters in a total of eleven films. In preparation for these roles, Stallone embarked upon a vigorous training regimen, which often meant six days a week in the gym and further sit-ups in the evenings. Stallone claims to have reduced his [[body fat percentage]] to his all-time low of 2.8% for ''Rocky III''.<ref>Berg, Michael. ''Muscle & Fitness'', Sept. 2004.</ref> Stallone met former [[Mr. Olympia]] [[Franco Columbu]] to develop his character's appearance for the films ''Rocky IV'' and ''Rambo II'', just as if he were preparing for the Mr. Olympia competition.

These films did not do well at the box office and were poorly received by critics. It was around 1985 that Stallone was signed to a remake of the 1939 [[James Cagney]] classic ''[[Angels With Dirty Faces]]''. The film would form part of his multi-picture deal with Cannon Films and was to co-star [[Christopher Reeve]] and be directed by [[Menahem Golan]]. The re-making of such a beloved classic was met with disapproval by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and horror by top critic [[Roger Ebert]]. Cannon opted to make ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]]'' instead. ''Cobra'' (1986) and the [[buddy cop]] action film ''[[Tango & Cash]]'' (1989), the latter alongside [[Kurt Russell]], did solid business domestically and blockbuster business overseas, grossing over {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million in foreign markets and over {{US$|160}}&nbsp;million worldwide.

Stallone began the 1990s starring in the fifth installment of the ''Rocky'' franchise, ''[[Rocky V]]''. This film brought back the original film's director John G. Avildsen. It was considered a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Home' KOs 'Rocky V' at Box Office : Movies: The comedy grabs {{US$|17}}&nbsp;million in receipts to take the No. 1 spot over Stallone's much-hyped sequel.|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-20/entertainment/ca-5106_1_weekend-box|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 20, 1990}}</ref> He attempted the comedy genre, starring in two comedies during the early 1990s, the critical and commercial disasters ''[[Oscar (1991 film)|Oscar]]'' (1991) and ''[[Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot]]'' (1992).

In 1993, he made a comeback with the hit ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', which was a success in the US, grossing {{US$|84}}&nbsp;million, but even more successful worldwide, grossing {{US$|171}}&nbsp;million. Later that year, he starred with [[Wesley Snipes]] in the [[futuristic]] action film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', which grossed over {{US$|158}}&nbsp;million worldwide. His string of hits continued with 1994's ''[[The Specialist]]'' (over {{US$|170}}&nbsp;million worldwide gross). In 1995, he played the futuristic character [[Judge Dredd]] (from the British comic book ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'') in the eponymous film ''[[Judge Dredd (1995 film)|Judge Dredd]]''. His overseas box office appeal saved the domestic box office disappointment of ''Judge Dredd'', which cost almost {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million and barely made its budget back, with a worldwide tally of {{US$|113}}&nbsp;million. Despite its performance, he signed a three-picture deal with [[Universal Pictures]] for $60 million, making him the second star after [[Jim Carrey]] to receive $20 million per film, however the deal expired in February 2000 without him making any films and therefore, received no payment.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=Spring 2000|issue=540|page=111|title=Big Deals|last=Fierman|first=Daniel}}</ref> He later appeared in the thriller ''[[Assassins (film)|Assassins]]'' (1995) with [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Antonio Banderas]] and the following year he starred in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Daylight (1996 film)|Daylight]]'' (1996).
[[file:Sylvester Stallone Cannes.jpg|thumb|upright|Stallone at the 1993 [[Cannes Film Festival]]]]
That same year, Stallone, along with an all-star cast of celebrities, appeared in the [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] short comedy film "[[Your Studio and You]]" commissioned by the [[Seagram]] Company for a party celebrating their acquisition of [[Universal Studios]] and the MCA Corporation. Stallone speaks in his Rocky Balboa voice with subtitles translating what he is saying. At one point, Stallone starts yelling about how can they use his Balboa character, that he left it in the past; the narrator calms him with a [[wine cooler]] and calling him "brainiac." In response, Stallone says, "Thank you very much." He then looks at the wine cooler and exclaims, "Stupid cheap studio!"<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 Your Studio and you] (From Google Video) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020045255/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 |date=October 20, 2012 }}</ref>

Following his breakthrough performance in ''Rocky'', critic Roger Ebert had stated that Stallone could become the next [[Marlon Brando]], though he barely recaptured the critical acclaim achieved with ''Rocky''. Stallone did go on to receive acclaim for his role in the crime drama ''[[Cop Land]]'' (1997), in which he starred alongside [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Ray Liotta]]. His performance led him to win the [[Stockholm International Film Festival]] Best Actor Award. In 1998, he did voice-over work for the computer-animated film ''[[Antz]]'', which was a big hit domestically.

=== Declining years: 2000–2005 ===
In 2000, Stallone starred in the thriller ''[[Get Carter (2000 film)|Get Carter]]'', a remake of the 1971 British [[Michael Caine]] film of the [[Get Carter|same name]], but the film was poorly received by both critics and audiences. Stallone's career declined considerably after his subsequent films ''[[Driven (2001 film)|Driven]]'' (2001), ''[[Avenging Angelo]]'' (2002) and ''[[D-Tox]]'' (2002) were also critical and commercial failures. In 2003, he played a villainous role in the third installment of the ''[[Spy Kids (film series)|Spy Kids]]'' series: ''[[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over]]'', which was a huge box office success (almost {{US$|200}}&nbsp;million worldwide). Stallone also had a cameo appearance in the 2003 French film ''[[Taxi 3]]'' as a passenger.

Following several poorly reviewed box office flops, Stallone started to regain prominence for his supporting role in the [[neo-noir]] crime drama ''[[Shade (film)|Shade]]'' (2003) which was only released in a limited fashion but was praised by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shade/ |title=Shade |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> He was also attached to star and direct a film tentatively titled ''Rampart Scandal'', which was to be about the murder of rappers [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and the surrounding [[Los Angeles Police Department]] corruption scandal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1472396/sylvester-stallone-making-movie-about-biggie-tupac-murders/|title=Sylvester Stallone Making Movie About Biggie, Tupac Murders|last=Patel|first=Joseph|date=June 6, 2003|publisher=[[MTV News]] |accessdate=June 9, 2020}}</ref> It was later titled ''Notorious'' but was shelved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur30196.cfm |title=Stallone's Tupac/Biggie Movie a No Go: Actor was to play LAPD detective who found dirty cops at root of murders |date=December 7, 2006 |publisher=EURWeb.com |accessdate=January 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In 2005, he was the co-presenter, alongside [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], of the [[NBC]] Reality television boxing series ''[[The Contender (TV series)|The Contender]]''. That same year he also made a guest appearance in two episodes of the television series ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]''. In 2005, Stallone also inducted wrestling icon [[Hulk Hogan]], who appeared in ''Rocky III'' as a wrestler named Thunderlips, into the WWE Hall of Fame; Stallone was also the person who offered Hogan the cameo in ''Rocky III''.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.donaly.com/celebrity_scene_weekly.html |title=Sylvester Stallone Rocky- Celebrity Scene Monthly By Don Aly Vol 36 |publisher= Donaly.com |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref>

=== Return to success: 2006–present ===
[[file:Sylvester Stallone Rocky VI 2005.JPG|thumb|16 years after filming ''[[Rocky V]]'', Stallone reprised his role as [[Rocky Balboa]] in 2006]]
After a three-year hiatus from films, Stallone had a comeback in 2006 with the sixth installment of his successful ''Rocky'' series, ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'', which was a critical and commercial hit. After the critical and box office failure of the previous installment ''[[Rocky V]]'', Stallone had decided to write, direct and star in a sixth installment which would be a more appropriate climax to the series. The total domestic box office came to {{US$|70}}.3&nbsp;million (and {{US$|155.7}}&nbsp;million worldwide).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=rocky6.htm |title=Rocky Balboa |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> The budget of the movie was only {{US$|24}}&nbsp;million. His performance in ''Rocky Balboa'' has been praised and garnered mostly positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rocky_balboa/|title=Rocky Balboa|date=December 22, 2006|work=rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>

Stallone's fourth installment of [[Rambo (franchise)|his other successful movie franchise]] was titled simply ''[[Rambo (2008 film)|Rambo]]'' (''John Rambo'' in some countries where the first movie was titled ''Rambo''). The film opened in 2,751 theaters on January 25, 2008, grossing {{US$|6,490,000}} on its opening day and {{US$|18,200,000}} over its opening weekend. Its box office was {{US$|113,244,290}} worldwide with a budget of {{US$|50}}&nbsp;million.

Asked in February 2008 which of the icons (Rocky or Rambo) he would rather be remembered for, Stallone said "it's a tough one, but ''Rocky'' is my first baby, so ''Rocky."''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stv.tv/content/out/film/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms:/out/films/video_interviews/sylvester_stallone_rambo_video_interview|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518053857/http://www.stv.tv/content/out/film/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms%3A%2Fout%2Ffilms%2Fvideo_interviews%2Fsylvester_stallone_rambo_video_interview|url-status=dead|title=Sylvester Stallone: Rambo Returns, video interview with STV|archivedate=May 18, 2008}}</ref> He also stated that Rocky could be interpreted as the "[[conscious]]" and Rambo as the "[[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]" of the same character.<ref>Le Cercle, 2008-02-09, cinema talk-show on French television channel [[Canal+]], during a review of ''Rambo'', cited by Marie Sauvion: "Et quand il [Stallone] se mêle de psychologie, voire de psychanalyse, alors il a un discours, il dit, Rocky c'est la conscience, en gros, d'un même personnage, et Rambo ce serait son inconscient." / "And when he speaks in terms of psychology, or even psychoanalysis, he's got a discourse, he says, Rocky is the conscious, in broad strokes, of the same character, and Rambo would be his unconscious."</ref>[[File:Flickr - nicogenin - 66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra) - Sylvester Stallone (26).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Stallone in 2009 at the [[66th Venice International Film Festival]]]]

On July 23, 2019, in an interview with [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], Stallone said that a Rocky sequel and prequel are in development. Producer [[Irwin Winkler]] said “We’re very high on it" and that negotiations are underway for Stallone to write and star in the feature. “We’re very anxious to make it.” Stallone said the plot of the movie would be about Rocky befriending a young fighter who is an undocumented immigrant. "Rocky meets a young, angry person who got stuck in this country when he comes to see his sister. He takes him into his life, and unbelievable adventures begin, and they wind up south of the border. It's very, very timely." Stallone said. Stallone also said there are "ongoing discussions" about a Rocky prequel television series, which he hopes will land on a streaming service and the series will likely follow a young Rocky Balboa as a professional boxing hopeful. Stallone said producer Irwin Winkler is hesitant on making the series saying that "There was some conflict there, yes. He felt in his mind that “Rocky” was primarily a feature film, and he didn't see it as being translated for cable, so there was a big bone of contention."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/features/sylvester-stallone-rocky-ownership-stake-1203275639/ |title=Sylvester Stallone Feels Robbed of an Ownership Stake in 'Rocky': 'I Was Furious' |work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=July 23, 2019 |accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://popculture.com/movies/2019/07/23/sylvester-stallone-reveals-rocky-sequel-prequel-in-development/ |title=Sylvester Stallone Reveals 'Rocky' Sequel and Prequel Are in Development |work= popculture.com |accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>

=== Works in development ===
Following the releases of ''Creed II'' and ''Rambo V: Last Blood'', Balboa Productions has an extensive production slate. A film depicting the history of [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack "Galveston Giant" Johnson]], the first African-American boxing heavyweight champion is in development. The project was announced after Stallone's instrumental involvement in helping get Johnson a posthumous pardon from US President [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/jack-johnson-boxer-movie-sylvester-stallone-1202825380/|title=Sylvester Stallone to Make Movie About Trump-Pardoned Boxer Jack Johnson|first1=Dave|last1=McNary|date=May 30, 2018}}</ref> ''[[Samaritan (2020 film)|Samaritan]]'', a dark interpretation of the [[superhero]] genre, will star Stallone in the titular role, from a script written by Bragi Schut. Stallone will later star in the film adaptation of ''[[Hunter (Huggins novel)|Hunter]]'', a story which had originally been planned as the premise for ''Rambo V: Last Blood''. The story centers around Nathaniel Hunter, a professional tracker who is hired to hunt a half-human beast created as an experiment of a secret agency. The studio has yet to hire a screenwriter. A feature-length adaptation of the biographical novel, ''Ghost: My Thirty Years as an FBI Undercover Agent'' by Michael McGowan and Ralph Pezzullo about McGowan's career of over fifty undercover missions will follow, though there is no screenwriter attached to the project yet. Additionally, a film centered around black ops troops being written by retired Army Ranger, Max Adams, is also in development.

The television production slate includes ''Levon's Trade'' created by [[Chuck Dixon]], and a series adaptation of Charles Sailor's ''Second Son'' being written by Rob Williams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/sylvester-stallone-samaritan-hunter-balboa-productions-ghost-book-deal-1202483446/|title=Sylvester Stallone To Star In 'Samaritan' & 'Hunter', Acquires FBI Memoir As His Balboa Productions Ramps Up Slate|first1=Amanda|last1=N'Duka|date=October 17, 2018}}</ref>

==Other film works==
Stallone's debut as a director came in 1978 with ''[[Paradise Alley]]'', which he also wrote and starred in. In addition, he directed ''[[Staying Alive (1983 film)|Staying Alive]]'', the sequel to ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', along with ''Rocky II'', ''Rocky III'', ''Rocky IV'', ''Rocky Balboa'', ''Rambo'' and ''The Expendables''.

In August 2005, Stallone released his book ''Sly Moves'' which claimed to be a guide to fitness and nutrition as well as a candid insight into his life and works from his own perspective. The book also contained many photographs of Stallone throughout the years as well as pictures of him performing exercises.

In addition to writing all six ''Rocky'' films, Stallone also wrote ''Cobra'', ''Driven'', ''Rambo'' and ''[[Homefront (film)|Homefront]]''. He has co-written several other films, such as ''F.I.S.T.'', ''Rhinestone'', ''Over the Top'', the first three ''Rambo'' films, the three ''The Expendables'' films and ''[[Creed II]]''.
