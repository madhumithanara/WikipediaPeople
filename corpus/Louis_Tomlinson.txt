He rose to fame as a member of the [[boy band]] [[One Direction]] after beginning his career as an actor, appearing as an extra in [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] drama film ''[[If I Had You (film)|If I Had You]]'' and the [[BBC]] drama ''[[Waterloo Road (TV series)|Waterloo Road]]''. In 2010, he auditioned as a solo contestant on the British music competition series ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]''. He was eliminated as a solo performer before he was put into a group with four other contestants, forming One Direction. The band has released five [[One Direction discography|albums]], embarked on four world tours, and won nearly 200 [[List of awards and nominations received by One Direction|awards]].

Following the group's hiatus in 2016, "[[Just Hold On]]" was released as Tomlinson's debut single as a solo artist in December 2016, it peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and was certified platinum in the UK. In 2017, Tomlinson released "[[Back to You (Louis Tomlinson song)|Back to You]]" with American singer [[Bebe Rexha]] and "[[Miss You (Louis Tomlinson song)|Miss You]]".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/one-direction-louis-tomlinson-signs-record-deal-epic-1202495906/ |title=One Direction's Louis Tomlinson Signs With Epic Records |last=Halperin |first=Shirley |date=14 July 2017 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=15 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715011706/http://variety.com/2017/music/news/one-direction-louis-tomlinson-signs-record-deal-epic-1202495906/ |archivedate=15 July 2017  }}</ref>

In 2018 Tomlinson appeared on the [[The X Factor (UK series 15)|fifteenth series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' as a judge and a mentor of the "Boys" category. He became the first former contestant of the show to become the winning mentor due to his mentee [[Dalton Harris]] winning the show. In 2019 Tomlinson released "[[Two of Us (Louis Tomlinson song)|Two of Us]]", "[[Kill My Mind (Louis Tomlinson song)|Kill My Mind]]", "[[We Made It (Louis Tomlinson song)|We Made It]]" and "[[Don't Let It Break Your Heart (Louis Tomlinson song)|Don't Let It Break Your Heart]]". In 2020 Tomlinson released "[[Walls (Louis Tomlinson song)|Walls]]", the title track of his debut solo album. The album ''[[Walls (Louis Tomlinson album)|Walls]]'' was released on 31 January 2020.

==Career==
===2010: ''The X Factor''===

He has also cited an admiration for and inspiration from [[Sam Fender]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Catfish and the Bottlemen]], and [[James (band)|James]]. He declared:

{{quote|My whole mission with this album is to not write these Hollywood-esque songs that talk about some unfathomable crazy love story. I'm so bored of that... Because I'm from up north, I grew up loving the likes of the Arctic Monkeys and Oasis. And the way they tell stories is such an effortless thing. It's real, it's honest and it's to the point, you know? Now, any of the Arctic Monkeys would be devastated to hear me talking like this, but there is a way of incorporating that conversational honesty into pop.<ref name="arctic monkeys"/>}}

Tomlinson, whose previous football experience had been to play and run his own pub team called Three Horseshoes, had agreed to play in a charity game at the [[Keepmoat Stadium]] in his home town of [[Doncaster]] to raise money for the Bluebell Wood Charity and was offered a deal by professional football club [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] to join the club on non-contract terms after impressing in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/celebrity-news/546742/omg-one-direction-s-louis-tomlinson-signs-for-football-club-doncaster-rovers |title=OMG!

He was given the squad number 28 for the [[2013–14 Doncaster Rovers F.C. season|2013–14 season]]. Tomlinson said of the move: "It's unbelievable really. I have been a massive football fan for a long time and growing up in Doncaster, I've been to plenty of games at the Keepmoat. To be part of the club is incredible." Rovers manager [[Paul Dickov]] joked, "He's missed pre-season training and he's having a holiday in America, so we'd better get him over here pretty soon."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/8850170/transfer-news-one-direction-singer-louis-tomlinson-has-signed-for-doncaster |title=Transfer News: One Direction singer Louis Tomlinson has signed for Doncaster |publisher=Sky Sports |date=2 August 2013 |accessdate=31 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805192707/http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/8850170/transfer-news-one-direction-singer-louis-tomlinson-has-signed-for-doncaster |archivedate=5 August 2013  }}</ref>

On 3 September 2013, it was announced that Tomlinson would make his debut for Doncaster's Reserve team in their [[The Central League|Central League]] fixture against the [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] reserve team on 18 September. Doncaster announced that despite the fixture being a reserve game they would be setting up a special ticket line for the match.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ticket details for One Direction star's football debut against Scunthorpe United|url=http://www.thisisscunthorpe.co.uk/Ticket-details-Direction-star-s-football-debut/story-19740273-detail/story.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130908195700/http://www.thisisscunthorpe.co.uk/Ticket-details-Direction-star-s-football-debut/story-19740273-detail/story.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 September 2013|date=3 September 2013|work=[[Scunthorpe Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Local World]]}}</ref> On 8 September, Tomlinson played for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in another charity match for [[Stiliyan Petrov]].

His rescheduled debut for Doncaster's reserve side in the Central League came as a 65th-minute substitute in a 0–0 game against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] on 26 February 2014, a charity match in aid of Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice attended by a crowd in excess of 4,000.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Oliver|title=One Direction: Louis Tomlinson's Doncaster Rovers 0–0 debut draws crowds|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-26356722|publisher=BBC South Yorkshire|accessdate=27 February 2014|date=26 February 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227161603/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-26356722|archivedate=27 February 2014}}</ref> Tomlinson later participated in bandmate [[Niall Horan]]'s Charity Football Challenge on 26 May 2014, at the [[King Power Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Derby County fan and One Direction star Niall Horan to hold charity football challenge|url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Derby-County-fan-Direction-star-Niall-Horan-hold/story-20974570-detail/story.html|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210202011/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Derby-County-fan-Direction-star-Niall-Horan-hold/story-20974570-detail/story.html|archivedate=10 December 2014}}</ref>
