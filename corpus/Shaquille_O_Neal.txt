==Early life==
[[File:Shaquille O'Neal - Cole High School 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|O'Neal playing for the Cole High School varsity basketball team in 1988–89.]]
O'Neal was born on March 6, 1972, in [[Newark, New Jersey]], to Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney, who played high school basketball (he was an All-State guard) and was offered a basketball scholarship to play at [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall]]. Toney struggled with [[drug addiction]] and was imprisoned for drug possession when O'Neal was an infant. Upon his release, he did not resume a place in O'Neal's life and instead agreed to relinquish his parental rights to O'Neal's [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] stepfather, Phillip A. Harrison, a career [[United States Army|Army]] sergeant.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wise |first=Mike |title=Shaq to biological father: 'I don't hate you' |url=http://theundefeated.com/features/shaq-to-biological-father-i-dont-hate-you/ |work=TheUndefeated.com (ESPN Inc.)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.filmreference.com/film/16/Shaquille-O-Neal.html|title=Shaquille O'Neal Biography (1972–) |work= filmreference.com}}</ref><ref name="LAT Plaschke"/> O'Neal remained estranged from his biological father for decades; O'Neal had not spoken with Toney or expressed an interest in establishing a relationship.<ref name="LAT Plaschke">{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/11/sports/sp-plaschke11|title='Biological Didn't Bother'| first= Bill| last= Plaschke|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 12, 2002|accessdate=January 21, 2011}}</ref> On his 1994 [[Hip hop music|rap]] album, ''Shaq Fu: The Return'', O'Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song "[[Biological Didn't Bother]]", dismissing him with the line "Phil is my father." However, O'Neal's feelings toward Toney mellowed in the years following Harrison's death in 2013, and the two met for the first time in March 2016, with O'Neal telling him, "I don't hate you. I had a good life. I had Phil."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theundefeated.com/features/shaq-to-biological-father-i-dont-hate-you/ |title=Shaq to biological father: 'I don't hate you' |first=Mike |last=Wise |work=The Undefeated |publisher=ESPN |date= September 9, 2016 |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}</ref>

O'Neal credits the [[Boys and Girls Club of America]] in Newark with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets. "It gave me something to do," he said. "I'd just go there to shoot.

O'Neal was injured for a great deal of the [[1995–96 NBA season|1995–96 season]], missing 28 games. He averaged 26.6 points and 11 rebounds per game, made the All-NBA 3rd Team, and played in his 4th All-Star Game. Despite O'Neal's injuries, the Magic finished with a regular season record of 60–22, second in the Eastern conference to the Chicago Bulls, who finished with an [[1995–96 Chicago Bulls season|NBA record 72 wins]]. Orlando easily defeated the [[Detroit Pistons]] and the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in the first two rounds of the [[1996 NBA Playoffs]]; however, they were no match for Jordan's Bulls, who swept them in the Eastern Conference Finals.

With the tandem of O'Neal and teenage superstar [[Kobe Bryant]], expectations for the Lakers increased. However, personnel changes were a source of instability during the [[1998–99 NBA season|1998–99 season]]. Long-time Laker point guard [[Nick Van Exel]] was traded to the [[Denver Nuggets]]; his former backcourt partner [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] was packaged with back-up center [[Elden Campbell]] for [[Glen Rice]] to satisfy a demand by O'Neal for a shooter. Coach [[Del Harris]] was fired, and former Lakers forward [[Kurt Rambis]] finished the season as head coach. The Lakers finished with a 31–19 record during the [[1998–99 NBA lockout|lockout-shortened season]]. Although they made [[1999 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]], they were swept by the [[San Antonio Spurs]], led by [[Tim Duncan]] and [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] in the second round of the Western Conference playoffs.

In 1999, prior to the 1999–2000 season, the Lakers hired [[Phil Jackson]] as head coach, and the team's fortunes soon changed.

After the 2001–2002 season, O'Neal told friends that he did not want another season of limping and being in virtually constant pain from his big right toe. His trademark mobility and explosion had been often absent. The corrective options ranged from [[reconstructive surgery]] on the toe to rehabilitation exercises with more shoe inserts and [[inflammation|anti-inflammation]] medication. O'Neal was already wary of the long-term damage his frequent consumption of these medications might have. He did not want to rush a decision with his career potentially at risk.<ref name=brown/>

For the [[2003–04 Los Angeles Lakers season|2003-04 season]], the team made a concerted off-season effort to improve its roster. They sought the free-agent services of forward [[Karl Malone]] and aging guard [[Gary Payton]], but due to [[NBA Salary Cap|salary cap]] restrictions, could not offer either one nearly as much money as they could have made with some other teams. O'Neal assisted in the recruitment efforts and personally persuaded both men to join the squad. Ultimately, both signed, each forgoing larger salaries in favor of a chance to win an NBA championship, which neither had accomplished in their careers (and which neither would achieve with the Lakers). At the beginning of the [[2003–04 NBA season|2003–04 season]], O'Neal wanted a contract extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30&nbsp;million. The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries.

===Miami Heat (2004–2008)===
[[File:Shaquille O'Neal1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|O'Neal with Miami in 2007]]

On July 14, 2004, O'Neal was traded to the [[Miami Heat]] for [[Caron Butler]], [[Lamar Odom]], [[Brian Grant]], and a future first-round [[draft (sports)|draft]] choice (who would turn into [[Jordan Farmar]] in the [[2006 NBA draft|2006 draft]]). O'Neal reverted from (his Lakers jersey) number 34 to number 32, which he had worn while playing for the Magic. Upon signing with the Heat, O'Neal promised the fans that he would bring a championship to Miami. He claimed one of the main reasons for wanting to be traded to Miami was because of their up-and-coming star [[Dwyane Wade]], to whom he gave the nickname "Flash". With O'Neal on board, the new-look Heat surpassed expectations, claiming the best record in the Eastern Conference in 2004–05 with 59 wins. He played in 73 games, his most since 2001 season, averaged 22.9 points a game along with 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. O'Neal made his 12th consecutive All-Star Team, made the All-NBA 1st Team, and won the Eastern Conference player of the Month award for his performance in March. O'Neal also narrowly lost the [[2004–05 NBA season|2004–05]] [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Award]] to [[Phoenix Suns]] guard [[Steve Nash]] in one of the closest votes in NBA history.<ref name="mvp_vote_2005">{{cite web | url = https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2005.html | publisher=Basketball Reference | title = 2004–05 NBA Awards Voting | accessdate =June 1, 2011}}</ref>

Despite being hobbled by a deep thigh bruise, O'Neal led the Heat to the [[2005 NBA Playoffs#Conference finals|Eastern Conference Finals]] and a Game 7 against the defending champion [[Detroit Pistons]], losing by a narrow margin. Afterwards, O'Neal and others criticized Heat head coach [[Stan Van Gundy]] for not calling enough plays for O'Neal.<ref>{{cite news

In August 2005, O'Neal signed a 5-year-extension with the Heat for $100&nbsp;million. Supporters applauded O'Neal's willingness to take what amounted to a pay cut and the Heat's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term. They contended that O'Neal was worth more than $20&nbsp;million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2122716 "Shaq makes long-term plans in Miami"].

In the second game of the [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06 season]], O'Neal injured his right ankle and subsequently missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and [[Pat Riley]] assumed head coach responsibilities.<ref name=ventre/> O'Neal later referred to Van Gundy as a "frontrunner" and a "master of panic."<ref>[http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=3953133 "Shaq rips Van Gundy for flop comment"]. Retrieved December 4, 2017.</ref> Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal during the rest of the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview "Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I knew I did something wrong.

====Fourth championship====
[[File:Heatwhitehouse.jpg|thumb|O'Neal holding the championship ball when the NBA Champion Heat visited the White House]]
In the [[2006 NBA Playoffs]], the Heat first faced the younger [[Chicago Bulls]], and O'Neal delivered a dominating 27 point, 16 rebound and 5 blocks performance in game 1 followed by a 22-point effort in game 2 to help Miami take a 2–0 lead in the series.  Chicago would respond with two dominating performances at home to tie the series, but Miami would respond right back with a victory at home in game 5. Miami returned to Chicago and closed out the series in the 6th game, highlighted by another dominating performance by O'Neal who finished with 30 points and 20 rebounds. Miami advanced to face New Jersey, who won a surprising game 1 victory before the Heat won four straight to assure a rematch with Detroit. The Pistons had no answer for Wade throughout the series, while O'Neal delivered 21 points and 12 rebounds in game 3 followed by 27 points and 12 boards in game 4 to help Miami take a 3-2 series lead.  The Pistons would win game 5 in Detroit, and Wade would once again get injured, but the Heat held on to win game 6 with O'Neal scoring 28 points with 16 rebounds and 5 blocks to help Miami reach their first ever NBA Finals.<ref name="Heat Playoffs Summary">[http://www.nba.com/heat/history/playoff_history_2006.html "Heat Playoff History 2006"]. Retrieved June 17, 2015.</ref>

In the Finals, the Heat were underdogs against the [[Dallas Mavericks]] led by [[Dirk Nowitzki]], and the Mavericks won the first two games at home in dominating fashion.  The Heat led by Wade and a balanced effort by O'Neal, [[Antoine Walker]] and [[Jason Williams (basketball, born 1975)|Jason Williams]] would go on to win all three of the next games at home, before closing out the series in Dallas to deliver the first NBA title for the franchise and O'Neal's fourth title.  With Wade carrying the offensive load, O'Neal did not need to have a dominating series, and finished with an average of 13.7 points and 10.2 rebounds for the series.<ref name="Heat Playoffs Summary"/>

In a rematch of the year before, the Heat faced the Bulls in the first round of the 2006–07 NBA playoffs. The Heat struggled against the Bulls and although O'Neal put up reasonable numbers, he was not able to dominate the series.

==National team career==
[[file:Shaquille v Spain 1994.jpg|thumb|upright|O'Neal with the US national team at the [[1994 FIBA World Championship]]]]
While in college, O'Neal was considered for the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]] to fill the college spot, but it eventually went to future teammate [[Christian Laettner]].<ref>[[ESPN]] [http://espn.go.com/nba/player/bio/_/id/614/shaquille-oneal]</ref> His national team career began in the [[1994 FIBA World Championship]] in which he was named [[FIBA World Cup MVP|MVP of the Tournament]]. While he led the [[United States men's national basketball team#Olympics|Dream Team II]] to the gold medal with an 8–0 record, O'Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double-doubles. In four games, he scored more than 20 points. Before 2010, he was the last active American player to have a gold from the [[FIBA World Cup]].

He was one of two players (the other being [[Reggie Miller]]) from the 1994 roster to be also named to the [[1996 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team III]]. Due to more star-power, he rotated with [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] and [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] and started 3 games. He averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with 8 total blocks. Again, a perfect 8–0 record landed him another gold medal at the [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|1996 Olympics]] in Atlanta. O'Neal was upset that coach [[Lenny Wilkens]] played Robinson more minutes in the final game; Wilkens previously explained to O'Neal that it would probably be Robinson's last Olympics.<ref>[[#oneal2011|O'Neal, MacMullan 2011]], p. 112.</ref>

After his 1996 experience, he declined to play in international competition. He was angered by being overlooked for the [[FIBA Americas Championship 1999|1999 FIBA AmeriCup]] squad, saying it was a "lack of respect".<ref>[[Jackie MacMullan]] [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1015501/index.htm The NBA], ''Sports Illustrated'', March 29, 1999.</ref> He forwent an opportunity to participate in the [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2000 Olympics]], explaining that two gold medals were enough.<ref>SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER and TIM KAWAKAMI [https://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/13/sports/sp-40593 O'Neal, Bryant Still Possible for Olympics], ''Los Angeles Times'', June 13, 2000.</ref> Shaq also chose not to play in the [[2002 FIBA World Championship]].<ref>[[Chris Sheridan (sportswriter)|Chris Sheridan]] [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020902&slug=basket02 Weight of the world leans on U.S. team], ''The Seattle Times'', September 2, 2002.</ref> He rejected an offer to play in the [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2004 Olympics]],<ref>[[Marc Stein (reporter)|Marc Stein]] [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&id=1812395 Team USA carousel continues], ''[[ESPN]]'', May 29, 2004.</ref> and although he was initially interested in being named for 2006–2008 US preliminary roster,<ref>AP [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2283371 Colangelo says Shaq not ruling out Olympics], ''[[ESPN]]'', January 7, 2006.</ref> he eventually declined the invitation.<ref>Michael Cunningham [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2006-07-21/news/0607201619_1_nba-teams-usa-basketball-nba-players/2 Full Summer Gives U.s.

==Player profile==
[[File:Shaquille O'Neal Free Throw.jpg|thumb|upright|left|O'Neal's free throw shooting was regarded as one of his major weaknesses.]]

O'Neal established himself as an overpowering low post presence, putting up career averages of 23.7 points on .582 field goal accuracy, 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game.

At {{height|ft=7|in=1}}, {{convert|330|lb|kg|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/suns/news/tribune_080207_shaq.html |title=SUNS: Shaq on Board |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}</ref> and U.S. [[shoe size]] 23,<ref name=nbabio/> he became famous for his physical stature. His physical frame gave him a power advantage over most opponents.  On two occasions during his first season in the NBA, his powerful dunks [[backboard shattering|broke the steel backboard supports]], prompting the league to increase the brace strength and stability of the backboards for the following 1993–94 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-09-13/sports/9309130272_1_backboard-new-rule-tiebreaker |title=New This Year In Nba: Shaq-proof Backboards |last=Roberts |first=Selena |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=September 13, 1993 |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}</ref>

O'Neal's "[[drop step]]", (called the "Black Tornado" by O'Neal) in which he posted up a defender, turned around and, using his elbows for leverage, powered past him for a very high-percentage [[slam dunk]], proved an effective offensive weapon. In addition, O'Neal frequently used a right-handed [[Hook shot|jump hook]] shot to score near the basket. The ability to dunk contributed to his career field goal accuracy of .582, second only to [[Artis Gilmore]] as the highest field goal percentage of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/FGP_career.html |title=Career Leaders and Records for Field Goal Pct |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}</ref> He led the NBA in field goal percentage 10 times, breaking [[Wilt Chamberlain]]'s record of nine.<ref name=nbabio/>

Opposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal, reducing the playing time of their own big men. O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280429024|title=Phoenix Suns vs. San Antonio Spurs - Recap - April 29, 2008|publisher=ESPN|date=April 29, 2008|accessdate=December 9, 2011}}</ref>

O'Neal's primary weakness was his [[free throw]] shooting, with a career average of 52.7%. He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] on December 8, 2000, a record.<ref>{{cite web |author=Through the 2004–2005 season |url=http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_freethrows.html |title=Regular Season Records: Free Throws |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=December 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724135025/http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_freethrows.html |archive-date=July 24, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> O'Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue, as he often shot 80&nbsp;percent in practice.<ref>[[#oneal2011|O'Neal, MacMullan 2011]], p. 139.</ref> In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as "[[Hack-a-Shaq]]".

On December 25, 2008, O'Neal missed his 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/games/20081225/SASPHX/recap.html |title=Mason's 3-pointer gives Spurs 91–90 win over Suns |agency=Associated Press |date=December 25, 2008 |author=Bob Baum |publisher=nba.com |access-date=May 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305142443/http://www.nba.com/games/20081225/SASPHX/recap.html |archive-date=March 5, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

O'Neal only made one three point shot during his entire career. He made the shot during the 1995–96 NBA season with the Orlando Magic. His career three point shot record is 1 for 22 (a 4.5% career percentage).

O'Neal was a capable defender, named three times to the All-NBA Second Defensive Team. His presence intimidated opposing players shooting near the basket, and he averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game over the course of his career.<ref>Benjamin, Josh. (September 21, 2012).

The quip inspired countless citations and references by announcers during those playoffs, though Dampier himself offered little response to the insult.

O'Neal was very vocal with the media, often making jabs at former Laker teammate Kobe Bryant. In the summer of 2005, when asked about Bryant, he responded, "I'm sorry, who?" and continued to pretend that he did not know who Bryant was until well into the 2005–06 season.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1187093/2/index.htm An A-to-Z remembrance of Shaq's career—basketball and (mostly) otherwise] – Sports Illustrated, CNN</ref>

O'Neal also appeared on television on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (he was initially picked to host the second episode of season 24 in 1998, but had to back down due to scheduling conflicts, being replaced by [[Kelsey Grammer]]; however, he did appear in two sketches during the episode) and in 2007 hosted ''Shaq's Big Challenge'', a reality show on ABC in which he challenged Florida kids to lose weight and stay in shape.

When the Lakers faced the Heat on January 16, 2006, O'Neal and Bryant made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, an event that was believed to signify the end of the so-called "[[Bryant–O'Neal feud]]" that had festered since the center left Los Angeles. O'Neal was quoted as saying that he accepted the advice of NBA legend [[Bill Russell]] to make peace with Bryant.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=260116013 |publisher=ESPN |title=Miami vs. Los Angeles – Recap |date=January 16, 2006 |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> However, on June 22, 2008, O'Neal [[Freestyle rap|freestyled]] a diss rap about Bryant in a New York club.
