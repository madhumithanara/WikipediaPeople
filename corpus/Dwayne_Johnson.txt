Johnson was a [[college football]] player for the [[University of Miami]], with whom he won a [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championship]] in [[1991 Miami Hurricanes football team|1991]]. He initially aspired for a professional career in football and entered the [[1995 NFL Draft]], but went undrafted. As a result, he signed with the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), but was cut from the team in the middle of his first season. Shortly after, he began training as a professional wrestler.<ref>{{cite news |title=20 Surprising Facts About Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson |work=Hollywood.com |url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/things-you-didnt-know-about-the-rock-60361722/ |accessdate=August 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826193854/http://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/things-you-didnt-know-about-the-rock-60361722/ |archivedate=August 26, 2015}}</ref> 

In 1996, Johnson secured a contract with the WWF and was promoted as the first third-generation wrestler in the company's history, as he is the son of [[Rocky Johnson]] and grandson of [[Peter Maivia]].<ref name="slam"/> He rose to prominence after developing a charismatic persona of a boastful, trash-talking wrestler named the Rock. He subsequently won his first [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] in 1998 and helped usher the WWF into the "[[Attitude Era]]", a boom period in the company's business in the late 1990s and early 2000s which still holds professional wrestling records for television ratings.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/3730706-wwe-care-record-low-tv-ratings-yet |title=Why WWE Doesn't Care About Record-Low TV Ratings...

The Rock would then regularly insult the audience, WWF performers, and interviewers in his [[Promos (professional wrestling)|promos]].<ref name="nation" />

On March 29, at [[WrestleMania XIV]], he defeated Shamrock by disqualification once again to retain the title. The next night, on ''Raw is War'', the Rock debuted a new Intercontinental Championship design and would later overthrow Faarooq as leader of the Nation of Domination to spark a feud between the two. He then successfully defended the Intercontinental title against Faarooq at [[Over the Edge: In Your House]] on May 31. The stable would then refer to themselves as simply "The Nation".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse22.html |title=In Your House 22: Over the Edge 1998 results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |accessdate=March 19, 2008}}</ref>

The Rock and The Nation then feuded with [[Triple H]] and [[D-Generation X]], with the two stable leaders first meeting in the quarter-final of the [[King of the Ring (1998)#King of the Ring bracket|1998]] [[King of the Ring tournament]], which the Rock won. At [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]], the Rock defeated [[Dan Severn]] in the semi-final match and lost to rival Ken Shamrock in the final.

The Rock saw a big uptick in fan support during this time, causing him to be booked in a feud with fellow Nation members [[Mark Henry]] and D'Lo Brown, turning babyface in the process.

The Rock continued to feud with Mankind over the WWF Championship, which was traded back and forth between them. First, in the main event of the January 4, 1999 episode of ''Raw Is War'', Mankind defeated the Rock after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |title=WWE RAW (1999) – January 4, 1999 – RAW |date=January 4, 1999 |accessdate=March 13, 2009 |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607173232/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |archivedate=June 7, 2008}}</ref> Then at the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]] on January 24, the Rock regained the title in a brutal [["I quit" match|“I Quit” match]], a type of match that only ends if one of the combatants says “I quit” on a microphone. Intended to show a vicious mean streak in the Rock's character, this match went horribly wrong as at the end of the match the Rock hit Mankind in the head with a steel chair 11 times instead of the scripted five, five shots already being a risky amount (most wrestling matches in the Attitude Era involving steel chairs had at most 2 or 3 shots to the head). After the 5th shot, Mankind was still at ringside instead of being two-thirds up the entrance ramp where he was supposed to be, and after the eleventh shot which knocked a bloodied Mankind out, a recording of Mankind saying "I Quit" from an earlier interview was played over the PA system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881143/results/ |title=Royal Rumble 1999 official results |publisher=WWE |accessdate=March 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/3044541412 |title=The Rock's second WWE Championship reign |publisher=WWE |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309231225/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/3044541412 |archivedate=March 9, 2008}}</ref> On January 31, during an episode of ''[[Sunday Night Heat]]'', the Rock and Mankind participated in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Empty Arena match|Empty Arena match]], a match that took place in an arena with 22,000 empty seats where any part of the facility could be used to contest the match.

The Rock returned in late July 2001, when the WWF was feuding with rival promotions, [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), during what's known as [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] storyline. In reality, WCW was purchased by Vince McMahon and the WWF, and ECW had gone out of business in early 2001. Many former WCW and ECW wrestlers were then brought onto WWF television and formed [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]] to compete with WWF in storyline. The Alliance and Vince McMahon then both attempted to persuade the Rock to join their team. The Rock then aligned with McMahon and the WWF. The next month, the Rock defeated [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], at [[SummerSlam (2001)|SummerSlam]], to win the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW Championship]] for the first time.<ref name="summerslam01">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/2001/mainevent/ |title=The Rock vs. Booker T w/Shane McMahon for the WCW Championship |accessdate=March 21, 2008 |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621123202/http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/2001/mainevent/ |archivedate=June 21, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/304454110223 |title=The Rock's first WCW Championship reign |accessdate=March 21, 2008 |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331155507/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/304454110223 |archivedate=March 31, 2008}}</ref> He later lost the title to [[Chris Jericho]] at [[No Mercy (2001)|No Mercy]].<ref name="nomercy01">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nomercy/history/2001/results/ |title=No Mercy 2001 official results |accessdate=March 21, 2008 |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224055025/http://www.wwe.com/shows/nomercy/history/2001/results/ |archivedate=February 24, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321134 |title=Chris Jericho and The Rock's first World Tag Team Championship reign |accessdate=March 21, 2008 |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311084859/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321134 |archivedate=March 11, 2008}}</ref> The next night on ''Raw'', he teamed with Jericho to win the WWF Tag Team Championship from [[The Dudley Boyz]].

As part of the WWF's battle against The Alliance, the Rock wrestled in a "winner takes all" five-on-five elimination tag team match at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] where the losing team's company would be dissolved in storyline. He was a member of Team WWF along with Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show. The Alliance's team consisted of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Booker T, [[Rob Van Dam]], and Shane McMahon. In the end, it came down to a one-on-one between the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Rock seemed to have the upper hand, until his teammate Jericho entered the ring and attacked the Rock. Austin tried to capitalize on this by pinning The Rock, but Kurt Angle revealed his true allegiance by attacking Austin. The Rock then pinned Austin, giving Team WWF the victory and forcing The Alliance to disband.
