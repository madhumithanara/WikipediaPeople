'''Steven Paul Jobs''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ɒ|b|z}}; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American [[business magnate]], [[industrial design]]er, [[investor]], and [[media proprietor]]. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of [[Apple Inc.]], the chairman and majority shareholder of [[Pixar]], a member of [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of [[NeXT]]. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the [[History of personal computers|personal computer revolution]] of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]].<!-- The lack of citations is purposeful because this is a summary of what is cited in the body. See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section#Citations. -->

Jobs was born in [[San Francisco]], California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. He attended [[Reed College]] in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and [[Hippie trail|traveled through India]] in 1974 seeking enlightenment and [[Buddhism in the West#Emerging mainstream western Buddhism|studying Zen Buddhism]]. His declassified FBI report states that he used [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] while he was in college, and once told a reporter that taking LSD was "one of the two or three most important things" he had done in his life.

Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's [[Apple I]] personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the [[Apple II]], one of the first highly successful mass-produced [[microcomputers]]. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the [[Xerox Alto]] in 1979, which was [[computer mouse|mouse]]-driven and had a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful [[Apple Lisa]] in 1983, followed by the breakthrough [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the [[desktop publishing]] industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple [[LaserWriter]], the first [[Laser printing|laser printer]] to feature [[vector graphics]]. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO [[John Sculley]]. That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple's members with him to found [[NeXT]], a [[computer platform]] development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the [[visual effects]] industry when he funded the computer graphics division of [[George Lucas]]'s [[Lucasfilm]] in 1986. The new company was [[Pixar]], which produced the first 3D computer animated feature film ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995).

Apple acquired NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few months. He was largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with designer [[Jony Ive]] to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the "[[Think different]]" advertising campaign and leading to the [[iMac]], [[iTunes]], [[iTunes Store]], [[Apple Store]], [[iPod]], [[iPhone]], [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], and the [[iPad]]. In 2001, the original [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] was replaced with a completely new [[macOS|Mac OS X]], based on NeXT's [[NeXTSTEP]] platform, giving the OS a modern [[Unix]]-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with a [[pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor]] in 2003. He died of [[respiratory arrest]] related to the tumor at age 56 on October 5, 2011.

== Background ==
===Biological and adoptive families===
Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, to Abdulfattah Jandali and Joanne Schieble, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs (née Hagopian).<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/steve-jobs/8811345/Steve-Jobs-adopted-child-who-never-met-his-biological-father.html |title=Steve Jobs: adopted child who never met his biological father |date=2011-10-06 |work=Daily Telegraph |access-date=2018-09-18 |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

His biological father, Abdulfattah "John" [[List of people from Homs#Families|(al-)Jandali]] ([[Arabic]]: عبد الفتاح الجندلي) (b. 1931), grew up in [[Homs]], Syria, and was born into an [[Arabs|Arab]] [[Muslim]] household.<ref name="sg" /> While an undergraduate at the [[American University of Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], he was a student activist and spent time in prison for his political activities.<ref name="sg" /> He pursued a PhD at the [[University of Wisconsin]], where he met Joanne Carole Schieble, a Catholic of Swiss and German descent.<ref name="sg" /><ref name="graff">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Steve-Jobs-son-of-Syrian-refugee-6640925.php |title=Social media reminds us Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian migrant |last=Graff |first=Amy |date=November 18, 2015 |website=SFGate |publisher=Hearst Communications |access-date=May 19, 2016}}</ref> As a doctoral candidate, Jandali was a [[Graduate teaching assistant|teaching assistant]] for a course Schieble was taking, although both were the same age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2015/11/16/steve-jobs-biological-father-syrian-migrant-some-note/75899450/|title=Steve Jobs' biological father was Syrian migrant, some note|last=Baig|first=Edward C.|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> [[Mona Simpson]], Jobs's biological sister, notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their daughter was dating a Muslim.<ref name="conv">{{Cite journal |last=Meer |first=Ameena |date=Summer 1987 |title=Artists in Conversation: Mona Simpson |url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/947/mona-simpson |journal=[[Bomb (magazine)|Bomb]] |access-date=July 7, 2015 |number=20}}</ref> [[Walter Isaacson]], author of the [[Steve Jobs (book)|''Steve Jobs'']] biography, additionally states that Schieble's father "threatened to cut Joanne off completely" if she continued the relationship.<ref name="graff" />

Schieble became pregnant with Jobs in 1954, when she and Jandali spent the summer with his family in [[Homs]], Syria. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: "without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me."<ref name="waits">{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2011/08/27/dad-waits-for-jobs-to-iphone/|title=Dad waits for Jobs to iPhone|last=Staff|date=August 27, 2011|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=June 27, 2015}}</ref>

Schieble gave birth to Jobs on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco and chose an adoptive couple for him that was "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy,"<ref name="bite" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}<ref name="NYT obit" /> but the couple later changed their mind.<ref name="bite" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jobs was then placed with Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education, and Schieble refused to sign the adoption papers.<ref>{{Cite book |ref={{harvid|Isaacson|2011}} |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2011 |title=Steve Jobs |title-link=Steve Jobs (book) |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |isbn=9781451648546}} pp. 3–4</ref> She then took the matter to court in an attempt to have her baby placed with a different family,<ref name="bite" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} and only consented to releasing the baby to Paul and Clara after the couple pledged to pay for the boy's college education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gadgetsnow.com/tech-news/Even-family-life-was-full-of-drama/articleshow/10261545.cms|title=Even family life was full of drama - Latest News {{!}} Gadgets Now|website=Gadget Now|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> 

When Steve Jobs was in high school, his mother Clara admitted to his girlfriend, [[Chrisann Brennan]], that she "was too frightened to love [Steve] for the first six months of his life ...

With regard to his biological parents, Jobs referred to them as "my sperm and egg bank. That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more."<ref name="auto" />

If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I was eager to hang out with my dad."{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|pages=5–6}} By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood.<ref name=journeyisreward/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a "loner."<ref name=journeyisreward/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom, tended to resist authority figures, frequently misbehaved, and was suspended a few times.<ref name=journeyisreward/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Clara had taught him to read as a toddler, and Jobs stated that he was "pretty bored in school and [had] turned into a little terror... you should have seen us in the third grade, we basically destroyed the teacher."<ref name=journeyisreward/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} He frequently played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary School in Mountain View.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|pages=12–13}} His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded him, however, and instead blamed the school for not challenging his brilliant son.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|pages=12–13}}

Jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene "Teddy" Hill, with turning him around: "She taught an advanced fourth grade class and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation. She bribed me into learning. She would say, 'I really want you to finish this workbook. I'll give you five bucks if you finish it.' That really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more that year than I think I learned in any other year in school.

==Homestead High==
[[File:Steve Jobs in 1972 Pegasus.jpg|thumb|upright|Jobs's 1972 [[Homestead High School (Cupertino, California)|Homestead High School]] yearbook photo]]
The location of the Los Altos home meant that Jobs would be able to attend nearby [[Homestead High School (Cupertino, California)|Homestead High School]], which had strong ties to [[Silicon Valley]].<ref name="JobsBio1">{{Cite book |title=Steve Jobs |title-link=Steve Jobs (book) |last=Isaacson |first=Walter |publisher=[[Little, Brown]] |year=2011 |page=16 |author-link=Walter Isaacson}}</ref> He began his first year there in late 1968 along with Bill Fernandez.<ref name=journeyisreward/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} (Fernandez introduced Jobs to Steve Wozniak, and would later be Apple's first employee.) Neither Jobs nor Fernandez (whose father was a lawyer) came from engineering households and thus decided to enroll in John McCollum's "Electronics 1."<ref name="journeyisreward" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} McCollum and the rebellious Jobs (who had grown his hair long and become involved in the growing counterculture) would eventually clash and Jobs began to lose interest in the class.<ref name=journeyisreward/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

He underwent a change during mid-1970: "I got stoned for the first time; I discovered Shakespeare, [[Dylan Thomas]], and all that classic stuff. I read [[Moby Dick]] and went back as a junior taking creative writing classes."<ref name=journeyisreward/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jobs also later noted to his official biographer that "I started to listen to music a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of just science and technology—[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Plato]]. I loved ''[[King Lear]]'' ... when I was a senior I had this phenomenal [[AP English Literature and Composition|AP English class]]. The teacher was this guy who looked like [[Ernest Hemingway]]. He took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite."{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=19}} During his last two years at Homestead High, Jobs developed two different interests: electronics and literature.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=19}} These dual interests were particularly reflected during Jobs's senior year as his best friends were Wozniak and his first girlfriend, the artistic Homestead junior [[Chrisann Brennan]].<ref name="bite">{{Cite book |title=The Bite in the Apple: A Memoir of My Life with Steve Jobs |title-link=The Bite in the Apple |last=Brennan |first=Chrisann |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |author-link=Chrisann Brennan}}{{Pages needed|date=April 2017}}</ref>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

In 1971 after Wozniak began attending [[University of California, Berkeley]], Jobs would visit him there a few times a week. This experience led him to study in nearby [[Stanford University]]'s student union. Jobs also decided that rather than join the electronics club, he would put on light shows with a friend for Homestead's avant-garde Jazz program. He was described by a Homestead classmate as "kind of a brain and kind of a hippie ... but he never fit into either group. He was smart enough to be a nerd, but wasn't nerdy. And he was too intellectual for the hippies, who just wanted to get wasted all the time. He was kind of an outsider. In high school everything revolved around what group you were in, and if you weren't in a carefully defined group, you weren't anybody. He was an individual, in a world where individuality was suspect." By his senior year in late 1971, he was taking freshman English class at Stanford and working on a Homestead underground film project with Chrisann Brennan.<ref name=journeyisreward/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} 

Around that time, Wozniak designed a low-cost digital "[[blue box]]" to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls. Jobs decided then to sell them and split the profit with Wozniak. The clandestine sales of the illegal blue boxes went well and perhaps planted the seed in Jobs's mind that electronics could be both fun and profitable.<ref name="Joomla">{{Cite web |url=http://www.i-programmer.info/history/people/104-steve-jobs-apple.html |title=Steve Jobs and the Early Apple Years |website=The PC Is Born |publisher=Joomla |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68ebFNtL3?url=http://www.i-programmer.info/history/people/104-steve-jobs-apple.html |archive-date=June 24, 2012 |access-date=March 27, 2012 |df=mdy}}</ref> Jobs, in a 1994 interview, recalled that it took six months for him and Wozniak to figure out how to build the blue boxes.<ref name="Steve Jobs 1994 Uncut Interview">{{Cite AV media |title=Steve Jobs 1994 Uncut Interview with English Subtitles |last=McBurney, Sally (Director) |publisher=Silicon Valley Historical Association |year=2013 |place=Menlo Park, California |medium=Video}}</ref> Jobs later reflected that had it not been for Wozniak's blue boxes, "there wouldn't have been an Apple".{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=30}} He states it showed them that they could take on large companies and beat them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFURM8O-oYI |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 14, 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402205622/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFURM8O-oYI |archivedate=April 2, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="Steve Jobs: Visionary Entrepreneur">{{Cite AV media |title=Steve Jobs: Visionary Entrepreneur |last=McBurney, Sally (Director) |publisher=Silicon Valley Historical Association |year=2013 |place=Menlo Park, California |medium=Video}}</ref>

By his senior year of high school, Jobs began using [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|page=19}} He later recalled that on one occasion he consumed it in a wheat field outside Sunnyvale, and experienced "the most wonderful feeling of my life up to that point".{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|pages=31–32}} In mid-1972, after graduation and before leaving for [[Reed College]], Jobs and Brennan rented a house from their other roommate, Al.<ref name="bite" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}<ref name="rs">{{Cite web |url=http://india.nydailynews.com/article/3ea39bee2a29179c3406250afd01c526/the-steve-jobs-nobody-knew |title=Jobs at 17: Nerd, Poet, Romantic |last=Brennan |first=Chrisann |date=October 19, 2011 |website=[[Rolling Stone Magazine]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425233149/http://india.nydailynews.com/article/3ea39bee2a29179c3406250afd01c526/the-steve-jobs-nobody-knew |archive-date=April 25, 2012 |access-date=February 9, 2015}}</ref>

As Jobs became more successful with his new company, his relationship with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now a part of their relationship, and Brennan, [[Daniel Kottke]], and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]].<ref name="bite" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple.<ref name="bite" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}<ref name="standingphoto">{{Cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/pictures-of-apples-first-employees-2013-12 |title=These Pictures of Apple's First Employees Are Absolutely Wonderful |last=Edwards |first=Jim |date=December 26, 2013 |website=Business Insider |access-date=January 19, 2015}}</ref> Brennan's relationship with Jobs deteriorated as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by [[Rod Holt]], who asked her to take "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples".<ref name="bite" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Both Holt and Jobs believed that it would be a good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan "turned ugly" at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: "I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I just didn't want to do that."<ref name="bite" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|pages=88–89}} Brennan turned down the internship and decided to leave Apple. She stated that Jobs told her "If you give up this baby for adoption, you will be sorry" and "I am never going to help you."<ref name="bite" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} According to Brennan, Jobs "started to seed people with the notion that I slept around and he was infertile, which meant that this could not be his child." A few weeks before she was due to give birth, Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm. She accepted the offer.<ref name="bite" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} When Jobs was 23 (the same age as his biological parents when they had him){{sfn|Isaacson|2015|pages=88–89}} Brennan gave birth to her baby, [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa Brennan]], on May 17, 1978.<ref name="bite" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}<ref name="pens">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/15/steve-jobs-chrisann-brennan-memoir-apple |title=Steve Jobs' ex-girlfriend pens memoir on life with 'vicious' Apple founder |last=Metz |first=Rachel |date=October 15, 2013 |website=The Guardian |access-date=January 17, 2015}}</ref> Jobs went there for the birth after he was contacted by [[Robert Friedland]], their mutual friend and the farm owner. While distant, Jobs worked with her on a name for the baby, which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket. Brennan suggested the name "Lisa" which Jobs also liked and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name "Lisa" while he "was also publicly denying paternity." She would discover later that during this time, Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name (his first choice was "Claire" after [[Clare of Assisi|St. Clare]]). She also stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby's name for a computer and he hid the plans from her. Jobs also worked with his team to come up with the phrase, "Local Integrated Software Architecture" as an [[backronym|alternative explanation]] for the [[Apple Lisa]].<ref name="Bullock">{{Cite web |url=http://www.minyanville.com/special-features/articles/lisa-brennan-jobs-business-icons-rich/8/31/2010/id/29768 |title=The Kids of Business Icons: Lisa Brennan-Jobs |last=Bullock |first=Diane |date=August 31, 2010 |website=[[Minyanville]] |access-date=October 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AKIQlC1c?url=http://www.minyanville.com/special-features/articles/lisa-brennan-jobs-business-icons-rich/8/31/2010/id/29768 |archive-date=August 31, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Decades later, however, Jobs admitted to his biographer [[Walter Isaacson]] that "obviously, it was named for my daughter".{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=93}}

When Jobs denied paternity, a [[DNA paternity testing|DNA test]] established him as Lisa's father. It{{clarify|date=August 2019}} required him to give Brennan $385 a month in addition to returning the welfare money she had received. Jobs gave her $500 a month at the time when Apple went public and Jobs became a millionaire. Later, Brennan agreed to give an interview with [[Michael Moritz]] for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine for its [[Time Person of the Year]] special, released on January 3, 1983, in which she discussed her relationship with Jobs. Rather than name Jobs the Person of the Year, the magazine named the computer{{clarify|date=August 2019}} the "Machine of the Year".<ref>"Machine of the Year: The Computer Moves in".

Jobs was worth over $1 million in 1978 when he was just 23 years old. His net worth grew to over $250 million by the time he was 25, according to estimates.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.investopedia.com/university/steve-jobs-biography/steve-jobs-net-worth.asp |title=Steve Jobs: Net Worth {{!}} Investopedia |date=2015-10-14 |work=Investopedia |access-date=2018-07-30 |language=en-US}}</ref> He was also one of the youngest "people ever to make the [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] list of the nation's richest people—and one of only a handful to have done it themselves, without inherited wealth".<ref name=journeyisreward/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

In 1982, Jobs bought an apartment in the two top floors of [[The San Remo]], a Manhattan building with a politically progressive reputation. Although he never lived there,<ref name="wirdem">{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/02/steve-jobs-house-dem/ |title=Photos: The Historic House Steve Jobs Demolished |date=February 17, 2011 |work=Wired}}</ref> he spent years renovating it with the help of [[I. M. Pei]]. In 2003, he sold it to [[U2]] singer [[Bono (U2)|Bono]].

In 1983, Jobs lured [[John Sculley]] away from [[Pepsi-Cola]] to serve as Apple's CEO, asking, "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?"{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|pages=386–387}}

In 1984, Jobs bought the [[Jackling House]] and estate, and resided there for a decade. After that, he leased it out for several years until 2000 when he stopped maintaining the house, allowing exposure to the weather to degrade it. In 2004, Jobs received permission from the town of Woodside to demolish the house in order to build a smaller contemporary styled one. After a few years in court, the house was finally demolished in 2011, a few months before he died.<ref name="sfch11">{{Cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/02/14/BAUK1HN0JR.DTL |title=Steve Jobs' historic Woodside mansion is torn down |last=Lee |first=Henry K. |date=February 15, 2011 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref>

Sculley's and Jobs's respective visions for the company greatly differed. The former favored [[open architecture]] computers like the Apple II, sold to education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to IBM. Jobs wanted the company to focus on the [[closed architecture]] Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC. President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the board Jobs's Macintosh division; it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies, duplicating services.<ref name="robbeloth198510_11">{{Cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/II_Computing_Vol_1_No_1_Oct_Nov_85_Premiere#page/n7/mode/2up |title=Whither Apple? |last=Robbeloth, DeWitt |date=Oct–Nov 1985 |work=II Computing |access-date=January 28, 2015 |page=8}}</ref> Although its products provided 85 percent of Apple's sales in early 1985, the company's January 1985 [[annual meeting]] did not mention the Apple II division or employees.

By early 1985, the Macintosh's failure to defeat the IBM PC became clear,{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|pages=185–187}}{{sfn|Schlender|2016|pages=84–88}} and it strengthened Sculley's position in the company. In May 1985, Sculley—encouraged by Arthur Rock—decided to reorganize Apple, and proposed a plan to the board that would remove Jobs from the Macintosh group and put him in charge of "New Product Development". This move would effectively render Jobs powerless within Apple.<ref name=journeyisreward/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} In response, Jobs then developed a plan to get rid of Sculley and take over Apple. However, Jobs was confronted after the plan was leaked, and he said that he would leave Apple. The Board declined his resignation and asked him to reconsider. Sculley also told Jobs that he had all of the votes needed to go ahead with the reorganization. A few months later, on September 17, 1985, Jobs submitted a letter of resignation to the Apple Board. Five additional senior Apple employees also resigned and joined Jobs in his new venture, [[NeXT]].<ref name="journeyisreward">{{Cite book |title=Steve Jobs: The Journey Is the Reward |last=Young |first=Jeffrey S. |date=1987 |publisher=Amazon Digital Services, 2011 ebook edition (originally [[Scott Foresman]])}}{{Pages needed|date=April 2017}}</ref>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

The Macintosh's struggle continued after Jobs left Apple. Though marketed and received in fanfare, the expensive Macintosh was a hard sell.<ref name="swaine1">Swaine, Michael and Paul Frieberger.

Although the Macintosh preceded the clones, it was far more expensive, so "through the late 1980s, the Windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple".<ref name=swaine1/>{{rp|322}} Windows-based IBM-PC clones also led to the development of additional GUIs such as IBM's TopView or Digital Research's GEM,<ref name=swaine1/>{{rp|322}} and thus "the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of the Mac...it seemed clear as the 1980s wound down that Apple couldn't go it alone indefinitely against the whole IBM-clone market."<ref name=swaine1/>{{rp|322}}

In 2003 and 2004, as Pixar's contract with Disney was running out, Jobs and Disney chief executive [[Michael Eisner]] tried but failed to negotiate a new partnership,<ref name="vanityfair">Wolff, Michael, {{Cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/04/wolff200604?currentPage=all |title=iPod, Therefore I am |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328111011/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/04/wolff200604?currentPage=all |archive-date=March 28, 2014}}, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', April 2006.

In October 2005, [[Bob Iger]] replaced Eisner at Disney, and Iger quickly worked to mend relations with Jobs and Pixar. On January 24, 2006, Jobs and Iger announced that Disney had agreed to purchase Pixar in an all-stock transaction worth $7.4&nbsp;billion. When the deal closed, Jobs became [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s largest single shareholder with approximately seven percent of the company's stock.<ref name="DisneyBuysPixar">January 25, 2006 {{Cite web |url=http://inhome.rediff.com/money/2006/jan/25disney.htm |title=Disney buys Pixar for $7.4 bn |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109012018/http://inhome.rediff.com/money/2006/jan/25disney.htm |archive-date=November 9, 2013}}, rediff.com</ref> Jobs's holdings in Disney far exceeded those of Eisner, who holds 1.7%, and of Disney family member [[Roy E.

After Jobs's death Iger recalled in 2019 that many warned him about Jobs, "that he would bully me and everyone else".

With the purchase of NeXT, much of the company's technology found its way into Apple products, most notably [[NeXTSTEP]], which evolved into [[Mac OS X]]. Under Jobs's guidance, the company increased sales significantly with the introduction of the [[iMac]] and other new products; since then, appealing designs and powerful branding have worked well for Apple. At the 2000 Macworld Expo, Jobs officially dropped the "interim" modifier from his title at Apple and became permanent CEO.<ref name="norr">{{Cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2000-01-06/business/17635644_1_mac-os-itools-apple-servers |title=MacWorld Expo/Permanent Jobs/Apple CEO finally drops 'interim' from title |last=Norr |first=Henry |date=January 6, 2000 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=June 27, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102181558/http://articles.sfgate.com/2000-01-06/business/17635644_1_mac-os-itools-apple-servers |archive-date=November 2, 2011}}</ref> Jobs quipped at the time that he would be using the title "iCEO".<ref name="Jobs announces new MacOS, becomes ">{{Cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/01/05/macworld.keynote/index.html |title=Jobs announces new MacOS, becomes 'iCEO' |date=January 5, 2000 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820231820/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/01/05/macworld.keynote/index.html |archive-date=August 20, 2013 |publisher=CNN |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2001, Jobs was granted stock options in the amount of 7.5&nbsp;million shares of Apple with an exercise price of $18.30. It was alleged that the options had been [[backdating|backdated]], and that the exercise price should have been $21.10. It was further alleged that Jobs had thereby incurred taxable income of $20,000,000 that he did not report, and that Apple overstated its earnings by that same amount.

In 2005, Jobs responded to criticism of Apple's poor recycling programs for [[e-waste]] in the US by lashing out at environmental and other advocates at Apple's annual meeting in Cupertino in April. A few weeks later, Apple announced it would take back iPods for free at its retail stores. The [[Computer recycling#Takeback|Computer TakeBack Campaign]] responded by flying a banner from a plane over the Stanford University graduation at which Jobs was the commencement speaker. The banner read "Steve, don't be a mini-player—recycle all e-waste."

Jobs announced his leave in a letter to employees, stating his decision was made "so he could focus on his health". As it did at the time of his 2009 medical leave, Apple announced that Tim Cook would run day-to-day operations and that Jobs would continue to be involved in major strategic decisions at the company.<ref name="times jan17 2011">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/technology/18apple.html |title=Apple Says Steve Jobs Will Take a New Medical Leave |last=Helft |first=Miguel |date=January 17, 2010 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=January 17, 2010}}</ref><ref name="medicalleave">{{Cite web |url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/01/17/steve_jobs_to_take_medical_leave_of_absence_but_remain_apple_ceo.html |title=Steve Jobs to take medical leave of absence but remain Apple CEO |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65C7gBNLZ?url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/01/17/steve_jobs_to_take_medical_leave_of_absence_but_remain_apple_ceo.html |archive-date=February 4, 2012 |df=mdy}}</ref> While on leave, Jobs appeared at the [[iPad 2]] launch event on March 2, the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|WWDC]] keynote introducing [[iCloud]] on June 6, and before the Cupertino City Council on June 7.<ref name="UFO_HQ">{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/06/cupertino-jobs-ufo-building/ |title=Video: Jobs Pitches New 'Mothership' to Approving Cupertino City Council |last=Abell |first=John |date=June 8, 2011 |work=Wired |access-date=June 9, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65C7gy0wA?url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/06/cupertino-jobs-ufo-building/ |archive-date=February 4, 2012 |df=mdy}}</ref>

===Apple I===
{{Main|Apple I}}
Although entirely designed by Steve Wozniak, Jobs had the idea of selling the [[desktop computer]], which led to the formation of [[Apple Computer]] in 1976. Both Jobs and Wozniak constructed several of the first Apple I prototypes by hand, and sold some of their belongings in order to do so. Eventually, 200 units were produced.<ref name="AppleStoryPart1"/>

===Apple II===
[[File:Micromodem II in Apple II.jpg|thumb|An [[Apple II]] with an external [[modem]], designed primarily by Wozniak]]
{{Main|Apple II series}}
The [[Apple II]] is an [[8-bit]] [[home computer]], one of the world's first highly successful mass-produced [[microcomputer]] products,<ref name="Ars Technica 2005-12-15" /> designed primarily by Wozniak (Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's unusual case{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|pages=73–83}} and [[Rod Holt]] developed the unique power supply<ref name="wozorg" />). It was introduced in 1977 at the [[West Coast Computer Faire]] by Jobs and Wozniak and was the first consumer product sold by Apple.

===Apple Lisa===
{{Main|Apple Lisa}}
The Lisa is a personal computer designed by Apple during the early 1980s. It was the first personal computer to offer a [[graphical user interface]] in a machine aimed at individual business users.

===NeXT Computer===

After Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, he started [[NeXT]], a [[workstation]] computer company. The NeXT Computer was introduced in 1988 at a [[NeXT Introduction|lavish launch event]].

Apple [[iMac G3]] was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple.

[[Chrisann Brennan]] notes that after Jobs was forced out of Apple, "he apologized many times over for his behavior" towards her and Lisa. She also states that Jobs "said that he never took responsibility when he should have, and that he was sorry".<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Bite in the Apple: A Memoir of My Life with Steve Jobs |title-link=The Bite in the Apple |last=Brennan |first=Chrisann |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |author-link=Chrisann Brennan|page=220}}</ref> By this time, Jobs had developed a strong relationship with Lisa and when she was nine, Jobs had her name on her birth certificate changed from "Lisa Brennan" to "Lisa Brennan-Jobs".<ref name="bite" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} In addition, Jobs and Brennan developed a working relationship to [[co-parent]] Lisa, a change Brennan credits to the influence of his newly found biological sister, [[Mona Simpson]] (who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs).<ref name="bite" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jobs found Mona after first finding his birth mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, shortly after he left Apple.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|pages=253–255}}

Jobs did not contact his birth family during his adoptive mother Clara's lifetime, however. He would later tell his official biographer [[Walter Isaacson]]: "I never wanted [Paul and Clara] to feel like I didn't consider them my parents, because they were totally my parents [...] I loved them so much that I never wanted them to know of my search, and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out."{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|pages=253–255}} However, in 1986 when he was 31, Clara was diagnosed with lung cancer. He began to spend a great deal of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption, information that motivated him to find his biological mother. Jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant. Although the doctor did not help Jobs while he was alive, he left a letter for Jobs to be opened upon his death. As he died soon afterwards, Jobs was given the letter which stated that "his mother had been an unmarried graduate student from Wisconsin named Joanne Schieble."{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|pages=253–255}}

Jobs only contacted Schieble after Clara died in early 1986 and after he received permission from his father, Paul. In addition, out of respect for Paul, he asked the media not to report on his search.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|pages=253–255}} Jobs stated that he was motivated to find his birth mother out of both curiosity and a need "to see if she was okay and to thank her, because I'm glad I didn't end up as an abortion. She was twenty-three and she went through a lot to have me."{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=254}} Schieble was emotional during their first meeting (though she wasn't familiar with the history of Apple or Jobs's role in it) and told him that she had been pressured into signing the adoption papers. She said that she regretted giving him up and repeatedly apologized to him for it. Jobs and Schieble would develop a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his life and would spend Christmas together.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}}

During this first visit, Schieble told Jobs that he had a sister, Mona, who was not aware that she had a brother.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=254}} Schieble then arranged for them to meet in New York where Mona worked. Her first impression of Jobs was that "he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy."{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=255}} Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk to get to know each other.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=255}} Jobs later told his biographer that "Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me . . . . As we got to know each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family. I don't know what I'd do without her. I can't imagine a better sister. My adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close."{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=255}}

{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="I grew up as an only child, with a single mother. Because we were poor and because I knew my father had emigrated from Syria, I imagined he looked like [[Omar Sharif]]. I hoped he would be rich and kind and would come into our lives (and our not-yet-furnished apartment) and help us. Later, after I'd met my father, I tried to believe he'd changed his number and left no forwarding address because he was an idealistic revolutionary, plotting a new world for the Arab people. Even as a feminist, my whole life I'd been waiting for a man to love, who could love me. For decades, I'd thought that man would be my father. When I was 25, I met that man, and he was my brother."|source=—[[Mona Simpson]]<ref name="eulogy" />}}

Jobs then learned his family history. Six months after he was given up for adoption, Schieble's father died, she wed Jandali, and they had a daughter, Mona.<ref name="sg">{{Cite news |url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentID=2011011891545 |title=The 'father of invention' |date=January 18, 2011 |work=Saudi Gazette |access-date=June 27, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701085311/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentID=2011011891545 |archive-date=July 1, 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=253}} Jandali states that after finishing his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him<ref name=sg/> (they divorced in 1962).<ref name="JobsBio1" />{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Mona for a period of time: <blockquote>I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't know where she was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida.<ref name=sg/></blockquote> A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=253}} Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name and thus became Mona Simpson. In 1970, after divorcing her second husband, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=253}}

When Simpson found that their father, Abdulfattah Jandali, was living in [[Sacramento, California]], Jobs had no interest in meeting him as he believed Jandali didn't treat his children well.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=256}} Simpson went to Sacramento alone and met Jandali, who worked in a small restaurant.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=257}} Jandali and Simpson spoke for several hours, during which time he told her that he had left teaching for the restaurant business.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=257}} He also said that he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that "we'll never see that baby again. That baby's gone."{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=257}} At the request of Jobs, Simpson did not tell Jandali that she had met his son.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=257}} Jandali further told Simpson that he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and that "all of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs ... oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy and a big tipper."{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=257}}

After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that "it was amazing ... I had been to that restaurant a few times, and I remember meeting the owner. He was Syrian. Balding. We shook hands."{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=257}} However, Jobs still did not want to meet Jandali because "I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn't trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it ... I asked Mona not to tell him about me."{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=257}} Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and asked "what is this thing about Steve Jobs?" Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, "My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive ... He never contacted Steve."{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}} Because Simpson herself researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}} Jobs also never showed an interest in his Syrian heritage or the Middle East.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}} Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in her 1992 novel ''[[The Lost Father]]''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}} [[Malek Jandali]] is their cousin.<ref>[https://hammer.ucla.edu/programs-events/2012/07/malek-jandali-mona-simpson-james-gelvin Conversations: Malek Jandali, Mona Simpson, & James Gelvin] (UCLA Hammer Museum event).

=== Marriage ===
In 1989, Jobs first met his future wife, [[Laurene Powell Jobs|Laurene Powell]], when he gave a lecture at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]], where she was a student. Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene "was right there in the front row in the lecture hall, and I couldn't take my eyes off of her ... kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a little giddy."<ref name=bsj/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} After the lecture, Jobs met up with her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner. From that point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, for the rest of his life.<ref name=bsj/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

Jobs proposed on New Year's Day 1990 with "a fistful of freshly picked wildflowers".<ref name=bsj/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} They married on March 18, 1991, in a Buddhist ceremony at the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]] in [[Yosemite National Park]].<ref name=bsj/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Fifty people, including Jobs's father, Paul, and his sister Mona, attended. The ceremony was conducted by Jobs's [[guru]], [[Kobun Chino Otogawa]]. The vegan wedding cake was in the shape of Yosemite's [[Half Dome]], and the wedding ended with a hike (during which Laurene's brothers had a snowball fight). Jobs is reported to have said to Mona: "You see, Mona [...], Laurene is descended from [[Joe Namath]], and we're descended from [[John Muir]]."{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=274}}

Jobs's and Powell's first child, Reed, was born September 1991.<ref>{{Cite book |ref={{harvid|Linzmayer|2004}} |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXnw5tM8QRwC&pg=PA81 |title=Apple Confidential 2.0: The Definitive History of the World's Most Colorful Company |last=Linzmayer |first=Owen W. |publisher=No Starch Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-59327-010-0 |access-date=April 15, 2014}} p.81</ref> Jobs's father, Paul, died a year and a half later, on March 5, 1993.
