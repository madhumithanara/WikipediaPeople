===Allegations of sexual assault===
In 2017, Sheen sued the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' over a story alleging that, in 1986, the then 19-year-old actor raped his 13-year-old co-star [[Corey Haim]] on the set of ''[[Lucas (film)|Lucas]]''. The case was settled in 2018. Haim's mother, Judy Haim, identified a different actor as her son's rapist on ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]'', and told ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' that Sheen never raped her son, calling the claims "made up".<ref>{{Cite web |first=Dominique|last=Mosbergen|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/charlie-sheen-national-enquirer-rape-allegations_n_5a2ceb32e4b0a290f05154b4 |title=Charlie Sheen Sues National Enquirer Over Corey Haim Rape Allegation |website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=December 10, 2017 |access-date=March 11, 2020}}</ref><ref name=HuffPo>{{Cite web|first=David|last=Moye|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/corey-feldman-charlie-sheen-rape-corey-haim_n_5e67b349c5b68d61645b8710 |title=Charlie Sheen Denies Corey Feldman's Accusation He Raped Corey Haim |website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=March 11, 2020 |access-date=March 11, 2020}}</ref>

==Activism==
===The Charlie Sheen effect===
Sheen's HIV-positive disclosure corresponded with the greatest number of HIV-related Google searches ever recorded in the United States. During the three weeks following his disclosure, there were about 2.75 million more searches than expected that included the term HIV, and 1.25 million searches were directly relevant to public-health outcomes because they included search terms for condoms, HIV symptoms, or HIV testing (e.g., "get HIV tested").<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ayers|first1=John W.|title=News and Internet Searches About Human Immunodeficiency Virus After Charlie Sheen's Disclosure|journal=[[JAMA Internal Medicine]]|publisher=[[American Medical Association]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|volume=176|issue=4|pages=552–4|date=February 22, 2016|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.0003|pmid=26902971|doi-access=free}}</ref>

A later study found Sheen's disclosure corresponded with a 95% increase in over-the-counter at-home HIV testing kits.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ayers|first1=John W.|s2cid=4416337|title=The Charlie Sheen Effect on Rapid In-home Human Immunodeficiency Virus Test Sales|journal=[[Prevention Science]]|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|location=New York City|volume=18|issue=5|pages=541–544|date=May 18, 2017|doi=10.1007/s11121-017-0792-2|pmid=28516308}}</ref>

Sheen, a lifelong fan of the [[Cincinnati Reds]], announced in August 2012 that he would donate $50,000 to the team's community fund, which supports various charities. The donation came after the team raised another $50,000 in an attempt to get sportscaster [[Marty Brennaman]] to shave his head on the field after a Reds victory. After Brennaman shaved his head, Sheen offered to match the previous donation total.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sheen doubles donations to Reds fund| url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2012/08/05/sheen-doubles-donations-to-reds-fund298200.html|work=Fox News|date=August 5, 2012|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}</ref>

Sheen is staunchly [[Vaccine hesitancy|opposed to vaccinations]].
