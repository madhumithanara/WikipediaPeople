Obama was born in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], making him the first president not born in the [[contiguous United States]]. After graduating from [[Columbia University]] in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in [[Chicago]]. In 1988, he enrolled in [[Harvard Law School]], where he was the first black person to be president of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama|represented the 13th district]] from 1997 until 2004 in the [[Illinois Senate]], when he [[United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004|ran for the U.S. Senate]]. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his well-received July [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|keynote address]], and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|his presidential campaign]] began, and after [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|close primary campaigns]] against [[Hillary Clinton]], Obama was [[2008 United States presidential election|elected]] over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John McCain]] and was [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] alongside [[Joe Biden]] on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the [[2009 Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate.

Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (commonly referred to as the "Affordable Care Act" or "Obamacare"), although without a [[public health insurance option]], the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], and the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]]. The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] and [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]] served as economic stimulus amidst the [[Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession]]. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the [[Budget Control Act of 2011|Budget Control]] and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|American Taxpayer Relief Acts]]. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia [[New START]] treaty, and [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007–2011)|ended military involvement]] in the [[Iraq War]]. He ordered [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military involvement in Libya]] for the implementation of the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|UN Security Council Resolution 1973]], contributing to the overthrow of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in [[death of Osama bin Laden|the deaths of Osama bin Laden]] and suspected Yemeni [[Al-Qaeda]] operative [[Anwar al-Awlaki]].

After winning [[2012 United States presidential election|re-election]] by defeating Republican opponent [[Mitt Romney]], Obama was [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|sworn in for a second term]] in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for [[LGBT American]]s. His administration filed briefs that urged the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to strike down [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] bans as unconstitutional (''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''); same-sex marriage was [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|legalized]] nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in ''Obergefell''. He advocated for [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] in response to the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], indicating support for a ban on [[assault weapons]], and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning [[global warming]] and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|military intervention in Iraq]] in response to gains made by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of [[ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan]] in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] on global climate change, initiated [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]] following the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|invasion in Ukraine]] and again after [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], brokered a [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|nuclear deal with Iran]], [[Cuban thaw|normalized U.S. relations with Cuba]], and became the first sitting president to visit the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]] and the [[African Union]]'s headquarters. Obama nominated [[Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates|three justices to the Supreme Court]]: [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and [[Elena Kagan]] were confirmed as justices, while [[Merrick Garland]] faced partisan [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|obstruction]] from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-led [[United States Senate|Senate]], which never held hearings or a vote on the nomination.

==== Religious views ====

Obama is a [[Protestant]] Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.<ref name="Christian" /> He wrote in ''[[The Audacity of Hope]]'' that he "was not raised in a religious household." He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person{{nbsp}}... I have ever known," and "a lonely witness for [[secular humanism]]". He described his father as a "confirmed [[Atheism|atheist]]" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." Obama explained how, through working with [[black church]]es as a [[Community organizing|community organizer]] while in his twenties, he came to understand "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change."<ref name="social change" />

[[File:Barack Obama talks with Benjamin Netanyahu (8637772147).jpg|thumb|Obama talks with Benjamin Netanyahu, March 2013.]]

On October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program increasing nuclear weapons production. The “Complex Modernization” initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. The administration built new plutonium pits at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico and expanded enriched uranium processing at the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.<ref>https://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/1/headlines</ref> In November 2013, the Obama administration opened [[Negotiations leading to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|negotiations]] with Iran to prevent it from acquiring [[nuclear weapon]]s, which included an [[Joint Plan of Action|interim agreement]]. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced July 14, 2015. The deal, titled the "[[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]]," saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].<ref>{{Cite news |title = Iran deal reached, Obama hails step toward 'more hopeful world' |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/14/us-iran-nuclear-idUSKCN0PM0CE20150714 |date = July 14, 2015 |accessdate = July 14, 2015 |newspaper = Reuters }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title = Iran, World Powers Prepare to Sign Nuclear Accord |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/embargo-on-arms-clouds-iran-nuclear-deal-1436831280 |date = July 14, 2015 |accessdate = July 14, 2015 |newspaper = Wall Street Journal |last1 = Solomon |first1 = Jay |last2 = Norman |first2 = Laurence |last3 = Lee |first3 = Carol E. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Landmark deal reached on Iran nuclear program |url = http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/14/politics/iran-nuclear-deal/ |date = July 14, 2015 |accessdate = July 14, 2015 }}</ref> In addition, the transfer of $1.7&nbsp;billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the republican party.

Garrett: As a member in good standing, were you a regular attendee of Sunday services? Obama: You know, I won't say that I was a perfect attendee. I was regular in spurts, because there was times when, for example, our child had just been born, our first child. And so we didn't go as regularly then. }}
