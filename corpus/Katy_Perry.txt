'''Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson''' (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as '''Katy Perry''', is an American singer, songwriter, and television judge. After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in [[gospel music]] as a teenager. Perry signed with [[Pamplin Music|Red Hill Records]] and released her debut studio album ''[[Katy Hudson (album)|Katy Hudson]]'' under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to [[Los Angeles]] the following year to venture into [[Secularity|secular]] music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers [[Glen Ballard]], [[Dr. Luke]], and [[Max Martin]]. After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]] and [[Columbia Records]], she signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Capitol Records]] in April 2007.

Perry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, ''[[One of the Boys]]'', a [[pop rock]] record containing the controversial U.S number one song "[[I Kissed a Girl]]" and "[[Hot n Cold]]". All subsequent albums have topped the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The [[disco]]-influenced ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' (2010) spawned five chart topping  U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles–"[[California Gurls]]", "[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]", "[[Firework (song)|Firework]]", "[[E.T. (song)|E.T.]]", and "[[Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)]]" — a record tying her with [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]''. Its follow-up record ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013) was inspired by her divorce and incorporates pop and dance along with themes of self-reflection, everyday life, and relationships. With the music videos for its chart-topping songs "[[Roar (song)|Roar]]" and "[[Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)|Dark Horse]]", Perry became the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on [[Vevo]]. 2017's [[electropop]] ''[[Witness (Katy Perry album)|Witness]]'' featured a political subtext and a theme of liberation. The album's lead single "[[Chained to the Rhythm]]" broke [[Spotify]]'s record at the time for most first-day streams for a song by a female artist. Her sixth studio album ''[[Smile (Katy Perry album)|Smile]]'' followed on August 28, 2020.

Perry has nine U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one singles and has [[List of awards and nominations received by Katy Perry|received various awards]], including four [[Guinness World Records]], five [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], five [[American Music Awards]], a [[Brit Award]], and a [[Juno Award]]. She has been included in the annual ''[[Forbes]]'' lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011–2019. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. She is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]], having sold over 18 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled ''[[Katy Perry: Part of Me]]'' in 2012, and voiced [[Smurfette]] in the 2011 film ''[[The Smurfs (film)|The Smurfs]]'' and [[The Smurfs 2|its sequel]] in 2013. Her [[Super Bowl XLIX halftime show]] performance is the most watched in history. Perry also began serving as a judge on ''[[American Idol]]'' in 2018.
