The media often comparing Fox to actress [[Angelina Jolie]],<ref name="Lee"/> dubbing her the "next Angelina Jolie", also affected her image.<ref name="Hirschberg"/> Amid this and reports that she was to replace Jolie in a new ''[[Lara Croft]]'' film,<ref name="Keyes">{{cite web|first=Rob|last=Keyes|title=Tomb Raider Reboot: Is Megan Fox In Or Out?|website=[[Screen Rant]]|date=January 29, 2009|accessdate=October 24, 2017|url=https://screenrant.com/tomb-raider-reboot-megan-fox/}}</ref> Fox commented that the comparisons indicate a lack of creativity on the part of the media,<ref name="Nashawaty"/> and attributed them to both she and Jolie being brunette, having tattoos, cursing, and mentioning and joking about sex,<ref name="NextJolie">{{Cite web|title=News – Megan Fox: Stop Comparing Me to Angelina Jolie! |website=[[Us Weekly]]|date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=June 4, 2014|url=http://m.usmag.com/entry/view/id/7921/pn/all/p/0/?KSID=250532ef720b705d4dc57458ca2573f6|archivedate=August 26, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826190746/http://m.usmag.com/entry/view/id/7921/pn/all/p/0/?KSID=250532ef720b705d4dc57458ca2573f6}}</ref><ref name="McKay">{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,535584,00.html??test=faces |title= Megan Fox Bites Back: I Talk About Sex, That Doesn't Make Me Angelina Jolie |first=Hollie|last=McKay |website=[[Fox News]]|date=July 30, 2009|accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> "which people find outrageous".<ref name="McKay"/> Lynn Hirschberg of ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined that "the Jolie comparison would probably have been made by the media eventually, but Fox sped up the process" by "linking herself to Jolie" and that she "enjoyed creating entertaining [[Copy (written)|copy]]" by telling "tales of darkness and lust."<ref name="Hirschberg"/>

In 2009, Fox's public image came under scrutiny when an unsigned letter from three crew members of ''Transformers'' defended director [[Michael Bay]] against accusations made by Fox about his on-set behavior, including a comparison with [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref name="Fennessey" /><ref name="Stransky">{{Cite news|last=Stranskyn|first=Tanner|title=Another Megan Fox letter—and this one sings her praises!|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=September 15, 2009|accessdate=November 14, 2014|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2009/09/15/megan-fox-michael-bay/}}</ref> In response to the letter alleging that Fox's on-set behavior is unpleasant and contrasts her public persona, Bay stated he does not condone the letter or Fox's "outlandish quotes", but "her crazy quips are part of her crazy charm", and that they still work well together.<ref name="Fennessey" /> A production assistant who worked on ''Transformers'' also stated that he never saw Fox act inappropriately on set.<ref name="Stransky"/> Fox said the letter's claims were false,<ref name="Hirschberg" /> and that she had privately spoken with the parties involved. She said she was "very fortunate" to be a part of the franchise, and was looking forward to continuing her work.<ref name="Stransky"/> DiPaolo concluded that Fox's criticism of the media sexually objectifying girls and women was in stark contrast to her sex symbol status and that this, "her defiance of director Michael Bay and frequent outspoken comments" stifled her career.<ref name="DiPaolo"/>

===Media exposure===
