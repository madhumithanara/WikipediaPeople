==Controversies==

=== Tax evasion ===
On November 26, 2013, a few days after Pacquiao's victory over Brandon Ríos, the Philippine [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines)|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] (BIR) issued a freeze order on all of Pacquiao's Philippine bank accounts due to his alleged failure to pay ₱2.2 billion in taxes for earnings he made in his fights in the United States from 2008 to 2009. A day after the bank account freeze, the BIR also issued an order to freeze all of Pacquiao's Philippine properties, whereupon Pacquiao presented documents to the press showing the income tax for non-resident alien payment by his [[Top Rank|promoter]] to the BIR's US counterpart, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), as well as a letter from [[Bob Arum]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/337272/economy/moneyandbanking/pacquiao-shows-us-tax-document-but-bir-says-it-has-no-proof-of-payment|title=Pacquiao shows US tax document but BIR says it has no proof of payment|work=GMA News}}</ref> In April 2017, Pacquiao, now a senator, approached Philippine authorities in an attempt to settle the case.

=== Homosexuality comments ===
Pacquiao is against [[same-sex marriage]] and has been quoted as saying "God only expects man and women to be together and to be legally married."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/16/manny-pacquiao-gay-marriage-leviticus-examiner_n_1521747.html|title=Manny Pacquiao Against Same-Sex Marriage But Never Said Gay People 'Must Be Put To Death'|work=The Huffington Post | date=May 16, 2012}}</ref>

}}

In February 2016, Pacquiao, in a video statement posted by [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]], made a comment on the issue of same-sex marriage. Pacquiao, in vernacular, described people in same-sex marriages as behaving worse than animals because, he said, animals generally do not have same-sex mating.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.abs-cbn.com/boxing/news/2016/02/16/pacquiao-draws-flak-masahol-pa-sa-hayop-comment-8860|title=Pacquiao draws flak for "masahol pa sa hayop" comment|publisher=[[ABS-CBN Sports]]|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> LGBT celebrities including comedian [[Vice Ganda]], singer [[Aiza Seguerra]], TV host [[Boy Abunda]] and the party-list [[Ladlad]] criticized the statements of the senatorial candidate. Pacquiao later apologized and stated that while, as a Christian, he is still against same-sex marriage, which he said is against Biblical teachings, he did not condemn gay people themselves.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35585016|title=Philippine boxer Manny Pacquiao apologises for gay slur|work=[[BBC]]|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] ended their longtime partnership with Pacquiao, stating his comments against gay people were abhorrent.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fernandez|first1=Erick|title=Nike Drops Manny Pacquiao Following Anti-Gay Comments|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nike-manny-pacquiao-anti-gay-comments_us_56c49e12e4b0b40245c8918c|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref> [[The Grove at Farmers Market]] in [[Los Angeles]] also [[Persona non grata|banned]] Pacquiao from the shopping mall.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/126323-pacquiao-banned-grove|title=Manny Pacquiao once again banned from The Grove over gay remarks|work=Rappler|date=March 18, 2016|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}</ref>

Towards the end of the video, Pacquiao clarified that he is not condemning gay people.

=== Disclosure of injury ===
It was revealed following [[Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao|Mayweather vs. Pacquiao]] that Pacquiao had sustained an undisclosed injury to his right shoulder while training and that while it had healed in time for the fight, he re-injured it during the 4th round. {{as of|2015}}, Pacquiao is currently facing a lawsuit of 5 million dollars filed against him by two fans for failing to disclose the shoulder injury in the lead up to his bout with [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.|Floyd Mayweather]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designntrend.com/articles/49947/20150505/manny-pacquiao-hit-with-5-million-class-action-lawsuit-after-two-fans-say-he-lied-about-his-injury-in-the-mayweather-fight.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507021746/http://www.designntrend.com/articles/49947/20150505/manny-pacquiao-hit-with-5-million-class-action-lawsuit-after-two-fans-say-he-lied-about-his-injury-in-the-mayweather-fight.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 7, 2015|title=Manny Pacquiao Hit With $5 Million Class-Action Lawsuit After Two Fans Say He Lied About His Injury In The Mayweather Fight|work=Design & Trend}}</ref> Pacquiao failed to disclose the injury to the Nevada State Athletic Commission in the pre-fight injury evaluation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/watch/cnbc/manny-pacquiao-failed-to-disclose-shoulder-injury-440750659566 |title=Manny Pacquiao faces class action lawsuit |work=NBC News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518093717/http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/cnbc/manny-pacquiao-failed-to-disclose-shoulder-injury-440750659566 |archivedate=May 18, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/pacquiao-failure-disclose-injury-perjury-article-1.2210373 | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Pacquiao's failure to reveal injury may bring perjury charge | date=May 5, 2015}}</ref> The commission did a standard injury report with Pacquiao filling out the form saying that he had no injuries heading into the bout. Pacquiao said he had sustained the injury weeks out from the fight against Mayweather. However, after the lawsuit from the two fans was filed against him, Pacquiao has since said that he sustained the injury during the fight in which it flared up in the 3rd round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/boxing/article4431663.ece|title=Nevada State stance rubs salt into Pacquiao's wound|work=The Times}}</ref> The Nevada State Athletic Commission stated at the post fight press conference that they had only just found out about Pacquiao's injury that evening at the post fight press conference. Speculation arose that the injury was an excuse for the loss to Mayweather because Pacquiao did not mention an injury in the post fight interview with [[Max Kellerman]]. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum stated that Pacquiao suffered the injury back in 2008, causing even more confusion as Pacquiao, now facing a lawsuit, had just previously stated that he suffered the injury during the fight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2015/05/arum-says-pacquiao-has-had-shoulder-injury-since-2008/|title=Arum says Pacquiao has had shoulder injury since 2008|work=Boxing News 24}}</ref>

=== COVID-19 concerns ===
On March 4, 2020, Pacquiao hosted a party at his residence, the attendees of which included fellow Senator [[Koko Pimentel]]. Pimentel was later diagnosed with COVID-19, prompting the Dasmarinas Village barangay council to order Pacquiao to self-isolate at his residence, declaring him a 'person under monitoring'.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-03-27|title=Manny Pacquiao, family asked to stay home|url=https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/28962449/manny-pacquiao-family-asked-stay-home|access-date=2020-08-25|website=ESPN.com|language=en}}</ref>
