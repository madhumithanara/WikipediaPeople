'''Brock Edward Lesnar''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|z|n|ər}}; born July 12, 1977) is an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2016/7/9/12126930/things-have-changed-greatly-but-if-not-for-ufc-100-ufc-200-wouldnt-be|title=Things have changed greatly, but if not for UFC 100, UFC 200 wouldn't be a big deal|first=Dave|last=Meltzer|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|date=July 9, 2016|website=MMAFighting.com|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> and former [[Mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] and professional [[American football|football]] player. He is best known for his time in [[WWE]]. He is an eight time overall [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]].

After his successful amateur wrestling career at [[Bismarck State College]] and the [[University of Minnesota]], Lesnar signed with WWE (then the World Wrestling Federation) in 2000. He was assigned to its [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental]] [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotional]] [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW) team, where he was a three-time [[OVW Southern Tag Team Championship|OVW Southern Tag Team Champion]] with [[Shelton Benjamin]]. After debuting on WWE's main roster in 2002, Lesnar won the [[WWE Championship]]<ref group="Note" name="WWEChamp">When Lesnar first won the title, it was known as the WWE Undisputed Championship. His second, third, and fifth were as WWE Champion, while his fourth was as WWE World Heavyweight Champion.</ref> five months after his debut at the age of 25, becoming the youngest champion in the title's history. Following his match with [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] at [[WrestleMania XX]], Lesnar left WWE and pursued a career in the [[National Football League]] (NFL).<ref name="start NFL"/> He was named a [[defensive tackle]] for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], but was cut before the start of the 2004 season.<ref name="NFL cut"/> In 2005, Lesnar returned to professional wrestling and signed with [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW), where he won the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] in his first match. After a contractual dispute with NJPW, he also wrestled as [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship (IGF)|IWGP Heavyweight Champion]] in the [[Inoki Genome Federation]] (IGF).

In 2006, Lesnar pursued a career in mixed martial arts (MMA), as he signed with [[Hero's]] and won his first fight, against [[Kim Min-soo (judoka)|Min-Soo Kim]], in June 2007.<ref name="MMA1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/a/elitexc-june2/?cur=page1|title=Brock Lesnar vs. Min Soo Kim|accessdate=March 22, 2008|publisher=UGO.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302160526/http://ugo.com/a/elitexc-june2/?cur=page1|archivedate=March 2, 2008}}</ref> He then signed with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) the following October. Lesnar lost in his UFC debut against [[Frank Mir]] and then won his second fight against [[Heath Herring]]. In November 2008, Lesnar defeated [[Randy Couture]] to become the [[UFC Heavyweight Champion]]. Shortly after a successful title defense in a rematch with Mir, Lesnar was sidelined due to [[diverticulitis]]. He would return at ''[[UFC 116]]'' to defeat Interim UFC Heavyweight Champion [[Shane Carwin]] and unify the heavyweight championships, becoming the undisputed UFC Heavyweight Champion in the process.<ref name =UFCreturn>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/universal-champion-brock-lesnar-ufc-champion-daniel-cormier-fight-ufc-226|title=Universal Champion Brock Lesnar to challenge UFC Champion Daniel Cormier|work=WWE|access-date=July 8, 2018|language=en}}</ref> Lesnar then lost the championship to [[Cain Velasquez]] at ''[[UFC 121]]''.

In April 2012, Lesnar returned to professional wrestling, rejoining WWE after an eight-year hiatus. Two years later, at [[WrestleMania XXX]], Lesnar defeated [[The Undertaker]] to end his [[The Streak (wrestling)|undefeated streak]] at [[WrestleMania]]. He achieved [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]] status five times after this, having won the WWE World Heavyweight/WWE Championship in 2014 and 2019 as well as the [[WWE Universal Championship]] in 2017, 2018, and 2019. His first reign as Universal Champion was the longest world title reign in WWE since 1988 at 504 days (though recognized as 503 days by WWE), the sixth-longest world championship reign in the promotion's history. In June 2016, at ''[[UFC 199]]'', the UFC advertised Lesnar's return to fight at ''[[UFC 200]]'' even though he was still contracted with WWE. Lesnar defeated his opponent [[Mark Hunt]] via unanimous decision. However, after Lesnar was tested positive for [[clomiphene]], a banned substance on the UFC's anti-doping policy, he was suspended from the UFC by the Nevada State Athletic Commission for one year and fined $250,000, and his victory over Hunt was overturned to a no-contest. Lesnar then retired from MMA for the second time in 2017.

Lesnar's rapid rise to the top of WWE in 2002 led to a feud with [[The Undertaker]], which involved a match at [[Unforgiven (2002)|Unforgiven]] on September 22.<ref name="pwi111">{{cite news|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work="Wrestling's historical cards"|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=110–111}}</ref> The match ended in a double [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]], with Lesnar retained the title.

Lesnar's next opponent was [[Big Show]] and Heyman was convinced more than anyone that Lesnar could not win, trying to talk him out of defending the title.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|page=290}}</ref> Lesnar refused and defended the championship against Show at [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]] on November 17. At the pay-per-view, Heyman [[Turn (professional wrestling)|turned]] on Lesnar, allowing Show to chokeslam him onto a steel chair and pin him to win the title, resulting in Lesnar's first [[Professional wrestling#Pinfall|pinfall]] loss in WWE.

On the following episode of ''SmackDown!'', however, Angle introduced Heyman as his manager and, despite promising Lesnar a title shot earlier in the evening, declared that Lesnar still would not get it. Lesnar's rivalry with Heyman and Big Show resumed, which culminated in a match at the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|Royal Rumble]] in January 2003, with the winner being placed into the Royal Rumble later in the evening. On January 19, Lesnar would defeat Show and entered the [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]] as the #29 entry. He eliminated Matt Hardy and [[The World's Greatest Tag Team|Team Angle]] ([[Charlie Haas]] and Lesnar's former OVW teammate [[Shelton Benjamin]]), who at the time, were mentored by Angle as a 3-man stable. Lesnar would then eliminate The Undertaker last and win the Royal Rumble, which guaranteed him a WWE Championship match at [[WrestleMania XIX]] since he was a SmackDown! wrestler.<ref name="pwi112"/> After the Royal Rumble, Lesnar and [[Chris Benoit]] defeated Angle, Haas and Benjamin in a three-on-two handicap match at [[No Way Out (2003)|No Way Out]] on February 23, despite Team Angle injuring their partner, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], backstage before the match.<ref name="pwi112"/> At WrestleMania XIX on March 30, Lesnar defeated Angle to win his second WWE Championship; during the match, he [[Botch (professional wrestling)|botched]] a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Shooting star press|shooting star press]] (a move he had used numerous times in OVW) and landed on his head and neck, resulting in a [[concussion]]. This forced Angle and Lesnar to improvise the finish of the match.

[[File:Lesnarbotch.jpg|thumb|Lesnar attempting a [[shooting star press]] at [[WrestleMania XIX]]]]
After WrestleMania XIX, Lesnar turned his attention to [[John Cena]], who had returned from injury in February 2003 after an ''F-5'' into a ringpost from Lesnar, with Cena claiming that Lesnar nearly ended his career and even named his new finishing move the "''[[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|F.U.]]''" as a jab at the new champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/j/john-cena.html|title=John Cena profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|quote=Brock Lesnar defeated John Cena, then gave Cena an F-5 into the ringpost, injuring his knee!|accessdate=April 21, 2007}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=March 2019}} The feud ended in a match at [[Backlash (2003)|Backlash]] on April 27, where Lesnar defeated Cena to retain the title. On the following episode of ''SmackDown!'', Lesnar returned to his rivalry with Big Show after, in the storyline, he injured [[Rey Mysterio]] badly during their match at Backlash. Show's attack resulted in Mysterio being carried out on a [[stretcher]] and backboard, and Show took Mysterio off the stretcher and swung the backboard into the ringpost, compounding the injury.<ref name="pwi112"/> Lesnar called out Show, who demanded that Lesnar put his title on the line against him. This led to a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|stretcher match]] for the championship at [[Judgment Day (2003)|Judgment Day]] on May 18, where Lesnar successfully retained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/2003/results|title=Full Event Results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}</ref> During the scripted rivalry on the June 12 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Lesnar lifted Big Show off the top-rope in a [[Suplex#Superplex|superplex]] which caused the ring to collapse on impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030612.html|title=SmackDown! results – June 12, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=April 21, 2007}}</ref> As Lesnar and Big Show continued their rivalry, Kurt Angle returned from his neck surgery and began to form a more friendly rivalry with Lesnar, as the two were allies, yet contenders for the title. At the first-ever SmackDown! brand-exclusive pay-per-view in July, [[Vengeance (2003)|Vengeance]], Lesnar lost the WWE Championship to Angle in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] involving Big Show, after he was pinned by Angle.

[[File:Lesnarangle.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Lesnar and [[Kurt Angle]] after their WWE Championship match at [[WrestleMania XIX]]]]
Lesnar continued to aggressively pursue the WWE Championship despite his friendship with Angle. [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] became involved in the angle, at first berating Lesnar, who had involved himself in McMahon's rivalry with [[Zach Gowen]], for losing to Angle. This all turned out to be a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Swerve|swerve]] that came into focus on the August 7 episode of ''SmackDown!'' in [[Kelowna, British Columbia]]. That night, Lesnar and McMahon were to face each other in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Steel cages|steel cage match]] with Angle as the [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|special guest referee]] as per McMahon's orders on the previous week's program. During the match, Lesnar had passed out due to a staged backstage incident and McMahon was set to pin him, but Angle refused to allow McMahon to win that way. As the two men began to argue, Lesnar attacked Angle with an ''F-5'' and kept attacking Angle while McMahon watched and celebrated with him afterwards, [[Turn (professional wrestling)|turning]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in the process.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Torch_Today_2/article_72489.shtml|title=WWE Smackdown Results August 7, 2003|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}</ref> At [[SummerSlam (2003)|SummerSlam]] on August 24,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030807.html|title=SmackDown! results – August 7, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=April 21, 2007}}</ref> Lesnar lost to Angle after [[Professional wrestling#Submission, knockout and incapacitating the opponent|submitting]] to the [[Professional wrestling holds#Ankle lock|ankle lock]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work="Wrestling's historical cards"|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=113–114}}</ref> After that, Lesnar would cement his villainous turn by brutalizing smaller wrestlers and attacking his rivals on a more consistent basis.

Lesnar successfully defended his newly won title against the debuting [[Paul London]] on October 9 episode of ''SmackDown!''. He returned to feud with The Undertaker, as Lesnar had previously cost Undertaker the title in a match against then-champion Kurt Angle, which granted him a shot at Lesnar's title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030925.html|title=SmackDown! results – September 25, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=April 21, 2007}}</ref> At [[No Mercy (2003)|No Mercy]] on October 19, Lesnar defeated Undertaker in a [[Professional wrestling match types#(Object) on a Pole match|Biker Chain match]] after interference from [[The Full Blooded Italians]] and [[Vince McMahon]].<ref name="pwi114">{{cite news|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated presents: 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts|work="Wrestling's historical cards"|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=114}}</ref> After Paul Heyman returned to WWE as SmackDown!

The Survivor Series in November 2003 also marked the first time Lesnar met [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] from the Raw brand. After Lesnar claimed in a backstage interview that he could beat anybody in the world, Goldberg interrupted the interview and introduced himself to Lesnar, shaking hands with him before leaving with a staredown.<ref name="pwi114"/> Lesnar followed this rivalry with a feud involving Hardcore Holly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/031211.html|title=SmackDown! results – December 11, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=April 21, 2007}}</ref> In the storyline, Holly wanted revenge on Lesnar for legitimately injuring his neck during a previous match between the two in 2002 which left Holly in need of neck surgery and out of action for a year.

Lesnar defended the WWE Championship against [[Eddie Guerrero]] at [[No Way Out (2004)|No Way Out]] on February 15. Goldberg attacked Lesnar with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]] while the referee was unconscious, allowing Guerrero to get a near-fall on Lesnar. Lesnar then attempted an ''F-5'' on Guerrero but Guerrero reversed it into a [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT]] on the title belt and executed a [[frog splash]] to win the WWE Championship.

Since Lesnar's debut, he was portrayed as a powerhouse athlete. He is often called by his nickname "The Beast Incarnate" or simply "The Beast".

After his match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, Lesnar sidelined his career in WWE to pursue a career in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) despite not playing football since [[high school]].<ref name="start NFL">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/03/16/384461.html|title=Lesnar talks about starting with the NFL|publisher=SLAM!

{{cquote|Brock Lesnar has made a personal decision to put his WWE career on hold to prepare to tryout for the National Football League this season.

Lesnar later told a Minnesota radio show that he had "three wonderful years" in WWE, but had grown unhappy and always wanted to play professional football, adding that he did not want to be 40 years old and wondering if he could have "made it" in football. In an interview about the NFL, he stated:

{{cquote|This is no load of bull; it's no WWE stunt. I am dead serious about this. I ain't afraid of anything and I ain't afraid of anybody. I've been an underdog in athletics since I was five. I got zero college offers for wrestling. Now people say I can't play football, that it's a joke. I say I can. I'm as good an athlete as a lot of guys in the NFL, if not better. I've always had to fight for everything. I wasn't the best technician in amateur wrestling but I was strong, had great conditioning, and a hard head. Nobody could break me.

During his first run in WWE, Lesnar developed addictions to both [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[Analgesic|painkillers]], allegedly drinking a bottle of [[vodka]] per day and taking hundreds of [[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Vicodin]] pills per month to manage the pain caused by wear and tear on his body.

In January 2001, Lesnar was arrested in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] for suspicion of possessing large amounts of [[anabolic steroid]]s.

Lesnar had previously signed a [[non-compete clause]] in order to be released from his contract with WWE, which prohibited him from working for any other professional wrestling companies before June 2010.
