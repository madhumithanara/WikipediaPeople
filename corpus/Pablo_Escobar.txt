'''Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|s|k|ə|b|ɑr}}; 1 December 1949{{spaced ndash}}2 December 1993) was a [[Colombian drug lord]] and [[narcoterrorist]] who was the founder and sole leader of the [[Medellín Cartel]]. Dubbed "The King of Cocaine," Escobar is the wealthiest criminal in history, having amassed an estimated net worth of US $30&nbsp;billion by the time of his death—equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|30|1990|{{Inflation-year|US}}|r=0}} billion as of {{Inflation-year |US}}—while his [[drug cartel]] monopolized the [[cocaine]] trade into the [[United States]] in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/10-facts-that-prove-the-absurdity-of-pablo-escobars-wealth-2015-9|title=10 facts reveal the absurdity of Pablo Escobar's wealth|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-07-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.unilad.co.uk/film/heres-how-rich-pablo-escobar-would-be-if-he-was-alive-today/|title=Here's How Rich Pablo Escobar Would Be If He Was Alive Today|date=2016-09-13|work=UNILAD|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729013104/https://www.unilad.co.uk/film/heres-how-rich-pablo-escobar-would-be-if-he-was-alive-today/|archive-date=29 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Born in [[Rionegro]] and raised in [[Medellín]], Escobar studied briefly at Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellín, but left without graduating; he instead began engaging in criminal activity, selling illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, as well as participating in [[motor vehicle theft]]. In the early 1970s, he began to work for various drug smugglers, often [[kidnapping]] and holding people for [[ransom]].

In 1976, Escobar founded the Medellín Cartel, which distributed powder cocaine, and established the first smuggling routes into the U.S. Escobar's infiltration into the U.S. created exponential demand for cocaine, and by the 1980s, it was estimated Escobar led monthly shipments of 70 to 80&nbsp;tons of cocaine into the country from [[Colombia]]. As a result, he quickly became one of the richest people in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.businessinsider.com/10-facts-that-prove-the-absurdity-of-pablo-escobars-wealth-2015-9|title= 10 facts reveal the absurdity of Pablo Escobar's wealth|publisher= businessinsider.com|date=February 2016}}</ref><ref name="auto">Page 469, ''Pablo Escobar, My Father.''

In the [[1982 Colombian parliamentary election|1982 parliamentary election]], Escobar was elected as an alternate member of the [[Chamber of Representatives of Colombia|Chamber of Representatives]] as part of the Liberal Alternative movement. Through this, he was responsible for community projects, such as the construction of houses and football fields, which gained him popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented. However, Escobar was vilified by the Colombian and U.S. governments,<ref name=":0"/> who routinely stifled his political ambitions and [[Search Bloc|pushed for his arrest]], with Escobar widely believed to have orchestrated the [[DAS Building bombing|DAS Building]] and [[Avianca Flight 203]] bombings in retaliation.

In 1991, Escobar surrendered to authorities, and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on a host of charges, but struck a deal of no [[extradition]] with [[President of Colombia|Colombian President]] [[Cesar Gaviria]], with the ability of being housed in his own, self-built prison, [[La Catedral]]. In 1992, Escobar escaped and went into hiding when authorities attempted to move him to a more standard holding facility, leading to a nation-wide manhunt.<ref name="DeathPablo">{{cite news|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/2006-11-08/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR-3317670.html|title=Familiares exhumaron cadáver de Pablo Escobar para verificar plenamente su identidad|work=El Tiempo}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> As a result, the Medellín Cartel crumbled, and in 1993, Escobar was killed in his hometown by [[Colombian National Police]], a day after his 44th&nbsp;birthday.<ref name="DEA">{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/history/1990-1994.html|title=Decline of the Medellín Cartel and the Rise of the Cali Mafia|publisher=U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration|accessdate=13 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118010530/http://www.dea.gov/pubs/history/1990-1994.html|archivedate=18 January 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Escobar's legacy remains controversial; while many denounce the heinous nature of his crimes, he was seen as a "[[Robin Hood]]-like" figure for many in Colombia, as he provided many amenities to the poor, while his killing was mourned and his funeral attended by over 25,000&nbsp;people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/pablo-escobar|title=Pablo Escobar: Biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, his private estate, [[Hacienda Nápoles]], has been transformed into a theme park,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medellinliving.com/hacienda-napoles-pablo-escobar/|title=Escobar's Former Mansion Will Now Be A Theme Park|publisher=Medellín Living|accessdate=July 17, 2019|date=13 January 2014}}</ref> and he has been praised and criticized for [[Pablo Escobar's hippos|importing hippopotamuses to Colombia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_ViOLgvsuY|title=How this drug lord [Escobar] created a hippo problem in Colombia|publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref> His life has also served as inspiration for or has been dramatized in film, television, and in music.

==Early life==
[[File:Panoramica Centro De Medellin.jpg|thumb|The city of [[Medellín]], where Escobar grew up and began his criminal career.]]
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria was born on 1 December 1949, in [[Rionegro]], in the [[Antioquia Department]] of [[Colombia]]. He was the third of seven children of the farmer Abel de Jesús Dari Escobar Echeverri (1910–2001),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Abel-de-Jes%C3%BAs-Escobar-Echeverri/6000000011716947998|title=Abel de Jesús Escobar Echeverri|publisher=Geni}}</ref> with his wife

Raised in the nearby city of [[Medellín]], Escobar is thought to have begun his criminal career as a teenager, allegedly stealing gravestones and sanding them down for resale to local [[smugglers]]. His brother, [[Roberto de Jesús Escobar Gaviria|Roberto Escobar]], denies this, instead claiming that the gravestones came from cemetery owners whose clients had stopped paying for site care and that he had a relative who had a monuments business.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.richestperson.org/colombian-drug-lord-pablo-escobar/ |title = Escobar Seventh Richest Man in the World in 1990 |publisher = Richest Person.org |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101206105551/http://www.richestpersons.net/colombian-drug-lord-pablo-escobar/ |archivedate = 6 December 2010 |accessdate = 13 February 2010}}</ref> Escobar's son, [[Sebastián Marroquín]], claims his father's foray into crime began with a successful practice of selling [[counterfeit]] high school diplomas,<ref name="auto"/> generally counterfeiting those awarded by the Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellín.

Escobar eventually became involved in many criminal activities with Oscar Benel Aguirre, with the duo running petty street [[scam]]s, selling contraband cigarettes, fake lottery tickets, and [[car theft|stealing cars]].<ref name="Rockefeller2016">{{cite book|author=J.D.

== Criminal career ==

=== Cocaine distribution ===
{{See also|Illegal drug trade in Colombia|Illegal drug trade in Panama|Illegal drug trade in the Bahamas}}
[[File:CIA Map of International illegal drug connections.gif|thumb|400px|International drug routes.]]
In ''The Accountant's Story'', [[Roberto de Jesús Escobar Gaviria|Roberto Escobar]] discusses how Pablo rose from middle-class simplicity and obscurity to one of the world's wealthiest men. Beginning in 1975, Pablo started developing his cocaine operation, flying out planes several times, mainly between Colombia and Panama, along smuggling routes into the [[United States]]. When he later bought fifteen bigger airplanes, including a [[Learjet]] and six helicopters, according to his son, a dear friend of Pablo's died during the landing of an airplane, and the plane was destroyed. Pablo reconstructed the airplane from the scrap parts that were left and later hung it above the gate to his ranch at [[Hacienda Nápoles]].

In May 1976, Escobar and several of his men were arrested and found in possession of {{convert|39|lb|kg}} of white paste, attempting to return to Medellín with a heavy load from [[Ecuador]]. Initially, Pablo tried to bribe the Medellín judges who were forming a case against him and was unsuccessful. After many months of legal wrangling, he ordered the murder of the two arresting officers, and the case was later dropped. Roberto Escobar details this as the point where Pablo began his pattern of dealing with the authorities, by either bribery or murder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medellintraveler.com/escobar.html |title=Pablo Escobar – The Medellin Cartel |publisher=Medellintraveler.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016122452/http://medellintraveler.com/escobar.html |archivedate=16 October 2007 |url-status=dead|accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref>

Roberto Escobar maintains Pablo fell into the drug business simply because other types of contraband became too dangerous to traffic. As there were no [[drug cartel]]s then, and only a few drug barons, Pablo saw it as untapped territory he wished to make his own. In [[Peru]], Pablo would buy the cocaine paste, which would then be refined in a laboratory in a two-story house in Medellín. On his first trip, Pablo bought a paltry {{convert|30|lb|kg}} of paste in what was noted as the first step towards building his empire. At first, he smuggled the cocaine in old plane tires, and a pilot could return as much as US$500,000 per flight, dependent on the quantity smuggled.<ref name="dailyrecord.co.uk">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/editors-choice/2009/03/16/amazing-story-of-how-pablo-escobar-came-to-be-the-richest-crook-in-history-86908-21201734/ |title=Amazing story of how Pablo Escobar came to be the richest crook in history |newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=Scotland |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref>

=== Rise to prominence ===
[[File:CocaineHydrochloridePowder.jpg|thumb|Powder cocaine was manufactured, packaged, and sold by Pablo Escobar and [[Medellín Cartel|his associates]], and eventually distributed to the U.S. drug market.|alt=]]
Soon, the demand for cocaine was greatly increasing in the [[United States]], and Escobar organized more smuggling shipments, routes, and distribution networks in [[South Florida]], [[California]], and other parts of the country. He and cartel co-founder [[Carlos Lehder]] worked together to develop a new trans-shipment point in the [[Bahamas]], an island called [[Norman's Cay]] about {{convert|220|miles|km}} southeast of the Florida coast. According to his brother, Escobar did not purchase Norman's Cay; it was, instead, a sole venture of Lehder's. Escobar and [[Robert Vesco]] purchased most of the land on the island, which included a {{convert|1|km|ft}} airstrip, a harbor, a hotel, houses, boats, and aircraft, and they built a refrigerated warehouse to store the cocaine. From 1978 to 1982, this was used as a central smuggling route for the [[Medellín Cartel]]. With the enormous profits generated by this route, Escobar was soon able to purchase {{convert|7.7|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of land in Antioquia for several million dollars, on which he built the [[Hacienda Nápoles]]. The luxury house he created contained a [[zoo]], a lake, a sculpture garden, a private bullring, and other diversions for his family and the cartel.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/transcripts/1309.html|title=The godfather of cocaine |work=Frontline |publisher=WGBH}}</ref>

At one point it was estimated that 70 to 80 tons of cocaine were being shipped from Colombia to the United States every month. In the mid-1980s, at the height of its power, the Medellín Cartel was shipping as much as 11 tons per flight in jetliners to the United States (the biggest load shipped by Escobar was {{convert|51,000|lb|kg}} mixed with fish paste and shipped via boat, as confirmed by his brother in the book ''Escobar''). Roberto Escobar also claimed that, in addition to using planes, his brother employed two small submarines to transport the enormous loads.<ref name="colombialink.com"/>

===Established drug network===
In 1982 Escobar was elected as an alternate member of the [[Chamber of Representatives of Colombia]], as part of a small movement called ''Liberal Alternative''. Earlier in the campaign he was a candidate for the ''Liberal Renewal Movement'', but had to leave it because of the firm opposition of [[Luis Carlos Galán]], whose presidential campaign was supported by the ''Liberal Renewal Movement''.<ref>Page 116, ''Pablo Escobar, My Father.'' Escobar, Juan Pablo. St. Martin's Press, New York. 2014.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1633817|title=SANTOFIMIO RECOMENDÓ MATAR A LUIS CARLOS GALÁN: POPEYE|first=Casa Editorial El|last=Tiempo|website=El Tiempo|date=2005-05-13}}</ref> Escobar was the official representative of the Colombian government for the swearing-in of [[Felipe González]] in [[Spain]].{{sfn|J.D. Rockefeller|2016|p=5}}

Escobar quickly became known internationally as his drug network gained notoriety; the Medellín Cartel controlled a large portion of the drugs that entered the United States, [[Mexico]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Venezuela]], and Spain. The production process was also altered, with coca from [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]] replacing the [[coca]] from Colombia, which was beginning to be seen as substandard quality than the coca from the neighboring countries. As demand for more and better cocaine increased, Escobar began working with [[Roberto Suárez Goméz]], helping to further the product to other countries in the [[Americas]] and [[Europe]], as well as being rumored to reach as far as [[Asia]].

====Palace of Justice siege====
[[File:PalacioDeJusticia2004-7-9Bogota.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Escobar was held directly responsible by various media publications for the 1985 [[Palace of Justice siege|storming of the Colombian Supreme Court]].]]
It is alleged that Escobar backed the 1985 [[Palace of Justice siege|storming of the Colombian Supreme Court]] by left-wing guerrillas from the [[19th of April Movement]], also known as M-19. The siege, a retaliation motivated by the Supreme Court studying the constitutionality of Colombia's extradition treaty with the U.S., resulted in the murders of half the judges on the court.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://historico.elpais.com.co/paisonline/notas/Noviembre162006/pablo.html|newspaper=El Pais |title=Cali Colombia Nacional Pablo Escobar financió la toma del Palacio de Justicia Escobar financió toma del Palacio de Justicia}}</ref> M-19 were paid to break into the Palace and burn all papers and files on ''[[The Extraditables|Los Extraditables]]'', a group of cocaine smugglers who were under threat of being extradited to the U.S. by the Colombian government. Escobar was listed as a part of ''Los Extraditables''. Hostages were also taken for negotiation of their release, thus helping to prevent extradition of ''Los Extraditables'' to the U.S. for their crimes.<ref>[[:es: Jhon Jairo Velásquez|Jhon Jairo Velásquez]] (obtained 21 October 2014)</ref>

===Escobar at the height of his power===
{{See also|Avianca Flight 203|DAS Building bombing}}
During the height of its operations, the Medellín Cartel brought in more than US$70 million per day (roughly $26 billion in a year). Smuggling 15 tons of [[cocaine]] per day, worth more than half a billion dollars, into the United States, the cartel spent over US$1,000 per week purchasing rubber bands to wrap the stacks of cash, storing most of it in their warehouses. Ten percent (10%) of the cash had to be written off per year because of "spoilage", due to rats creeping in and nibbling on the bills they could reach.<ref name="accountant">{{cite book|title=The Accountant's Story: Inside the Violent World of the Medellín Cartel|url=https://archive.org/details/accountantsstory0000esco|url-access=registration|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|author=Escobar, Roberto|year=2009}}</ref>

When questioned about the essence of the cocaine business, Escobar replied with "[the business is] simple: you bribe someone here, you bribe someone there, and you pay a friendly banker to help you bring the money back."<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/farmers-son-who-bribed-and-murdered-his-way-into-drugs-neither-government-forces-nor-other-drug-traffickers-were-interested-in-taking-pablo-escobar-alive-patrick-cockburn-reports-1465001.html |work=The Independent |location=London |title=Farmer's son who bribed and murdered his way into drugs: Neither government forces nor other drug traffickers were interested in taking Pablo Escobar alive.

While seen as an enemy of the United States and Colombian governments, Escobar was a hero to many in Medellín, especially to the poor. He was a natural at [[public relations]], and he worked to create goodwill among the poor of Colombia. A lifelong sports fan, he was credited with building [[football (soccer)|football]] fields and multi-sports courts, as well as sponsoring children's football teams.<ref name="accountant"/> Escobar was also responsible for the construction of houses and [[football (soccer)|football]] fields in western Colombia, which gained him popularity among the poor.<ref name="to apply the law">{{cite news|url= http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-166205|title= GARCÍA HERREROS CAUSA CONFUSIÓN|work=El Tiempo}}</ref><ref name="Killing Pablo">{{cite book |author=Mark Bowden |title=Killing Pablo: The Hunt For The World's Greatest Outlaw |publisher=[[Atlantic Monthly Press]] |location=New York |year=2001|title-link=Killing Pablo: The Hunt For The World's Greatest Outlaw |author-link=Mark Bowden }}</ref>{{sfn|J.D. Rockefeller|2016|p=5}} He worked hard to cultivate his [[Robin Hood]] image and frequently distributed money through housing projects and other civic activities, which gained him notable popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented. Some people from Medellín often helped Escobar avoid police capture by serving as lookouts, hiding information from authorities, or doing whatever else they could to protect him. At the height of his power, drug traffickers from Medellín and other areas were handing over between 20% and 35% of their Colombian cocaine-related profits to Escobar, as he was the one who shipped cocaine successfully to the United States.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

====La Catedral prison====
{{Main|La Catedral}}
After the assassination of [[Luis Carlos Galán]], the administration of [[César Gaviria]] moved against Escobar and the drug cartels. Eventually, the government negotiated with Escobar and convinced him to surrender and cease all criminal activity in exchange for a reduced sentence and preferential treatment during his captivity. Declaring an end to a series of previous violent acts meant to pressure authorities and public opinion, Escobar surrendered to Colombian authorities in 1991. Before he gave himself up, the extradition of Colombian citizens to the United States had been prohibited by the newly approved [[Colombian Constitution of 1991]]. This act was controversial, as it was suspected that Escobar and other drug lords had influenced members of the Constituent Assembly in passing the law. Escobar was confined in what became his own luxurious private prison, [[La Catedral]], which featured a football pitch, giant dollhouse, bar, jacuzzi, and waterfall. Accounts of Escobar's continued criminal activities while in prison began to surface in the media, which prompted the government to attempt to move him to a more conventional jail on 22 July 1992. Escobar's influence allowed him to discover the plan in advance and make a successful escape, spending the remainder of his life evading the police.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/23/world/colombian-drug-baron-escapes-luxurious-prison-after-gunfight.html?pagewanted=3&src=pm|title=Colombian Drug Baron Escapes Luxurious Prison After Gunfight|last=Treaster|first=Joseph B.|date=23 July 1992|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1992/jul/24/colombia.fromthearchive|title=Escobar escape humiliates Colombian leaders|first=Timothy|last=Ross|date=24 July 1992|via=www.theguardian.com|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

====Search Bloc and Los Pepes====
{{Main|Los Pepes|Search Bloc}}
Following Escobar's escape, the United States [[Joint Special Operations Command]] (consisting of members of [[SEAL Team Six|DEVGRU]] ([[SEAL Team Six]]) and [[Delta Force]]) and [[Intelligence Support Activity|Centra Spike]] joined the manhunt for Escobar. They trained and advised a special Colombian police task force known as the [[Search Bloc]], which had been created to locate Escobar. Later, as the conflict between Escobar and the governments of the United States and Colombia dragged on, and as the numbers of Escobar's enemies grew, a [[vigilante]] group known as ''[[Los Pepes]]'' ('''Los Pe'''rseguidos por '''P'''ablo '''Es'''cobar, "People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar") was formed. The group was financed by his rivals and former associates, including the Cali Cartel and right-wing paramilitaries led by [[Carlos Castaño Gil|Carlos Castaño]], who would later fund the [[Peasant Self-Defense Forces of Córdoba and Urabá]]. ''Los Pepes'' carried out a bloody campaign, fueled by vengeance, in which more than 300 of Escobar's associates, his lawyer<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-17/news/mn-24040_1_pablo-escobar |title=Angry Over Blast, Colombia Vigilantes Kill Escobar Lawyer}}"Angry Over Blast, Colombia Vigilantes Kill Escobar Lawyer". ''Los Angeles Times'', 17 April 1993</ref> and relatives were slain, and a large amount of the Medellín cartel's property was destroyed.

Members of the Search Bloc, and Colombian and United States intelligence agencies, in their efforts to find Escobar, either colluded with ''Los Pepes'' or moonlighted as both Search Bloc and ''Los Pepes'' simultaneously. This coordination was allegedly conducted mainly through the sharing of intelligence to allow ''Los Pepes'' to bring down Escobar and his few remaining allies, but there are reports that some individual Search Bloc members directly participated in missions of ''Los Pepes'' death squads.<ref name="Killing Pablo"/>{{page needed|date=May 2016}} One of the leaders of ''Los Pepes'' was [[Diego Murillo Bejarano]] (also known as "Don Berna"), a former Medellín Cartel associate who became a rival drug kingpin and eventually emerged as a leader of one of the most powerful factions within the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|Self-Defence of Colombia]].

==Personal life==

===Family and relationships===
In March 1976, the 26-year-old Escobar married María Victoria Henao, who was 15. The relationship was discouraged by the Henao family, who considered Escobar socially inferior; the pair eloped.<ref name="auto1"/> They had two children: Juan Pablo (now [[Sebastián Marroquín]]) and Manuela.

In 2007, the journalist [[Virginia Vallejo]] published her memoir ''Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar'' (''[[Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar]]''), in which she describes her romantic relationship with Escobar and the links of her lover with several presidents, Caribbean dictators, and high-profile politicians.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etgh1pGU7e0 |title=Los Narcopresidentes |last= |first= |date=24 November 2008 |access-date=15 October 2017 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Narco-presidents}}</ref> Her book inspired the movie ''[[Loving Pablo]]'' (2017).<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayorga |first=Emilio |date= 3 September 2017|title=Loving Pablo Director on Reuniting Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz: It's Been Very Intense |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/venice-facetime-loving-pablo-helmer-fernando-leon-de-aranoa-1202546440/ |work=Variety |location= |access-date=2017-10-18}}</ref>

A drug distributor, [[Griselda Blanco#Personal life|Griselda Blanco]] is also reported to have conducted a clandestine, but passionate, relationship with Escobar; several items in her diary link him with the nicknames "Coque de Mi Rey" (My Coke King) and "Polla Blanca" (White Dick).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXrqoXbnAAQ|title=Me Matan, Limon! -Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota|website=INEDITO|first=Tom|last= Jerry|date=30 September 2013|accessdate=19 June 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>

===Properties===
After becoming wealthy, Escobar created or bought numerous residences and [[safe house]]s, with the [[Hacienda Nápoles]] gaining significant notoriety. The luxury house contained a colonial house, a sculpture park, and a complete zoo with animals from various continents, including [[elephant]]s, exotic birds, [[giraffe]]s, and [[hippopotamus]]es. Escobar had also planned to construct a Greek-style [[citadel]] near it, and though construction of the citadel was started, it was never finished.<ref name="BBCJune2008">{{cite news |title=At home on Pablo Escobar's ranch |first=Mike |last=Ceaser |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7390584.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 June 2008 |accessdate=13 February 2010}}</ref>

Escobar also owned a home in the US under his own name: a 6,500 square foot (604&nbsp;m²), pink, waterfront mansion situated at 5860 North Bay Road in [[Miami Beach, Florida]]. The four-bedroom estate, built in 1948 on [[Biscayne Bay]], was seized by the government in the 1980s. Later, the dilapidated property was owned by Christian de Berdouare, proprietor of the Chicken Kitchen fast-food chain, who had bought it in 2014. De Berdouare would later hire a documentary film crew and professional treasure hunters to search the edifice before and after demolition, for anything related to Escobar or his cartel. They would find unusual holes in floors and walls, as well as a safe that was stolen from its hole in the marble flooring before it could be properly examined.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Business Insider]]|url= http://www.businessinsider.com/a-luxurious-miami-mansion-built-by-the-the-king-of-cocaine-is-no-more-2016-1|date=24 January 2016|title=Military & Defense: A luxurious Miami mansion built by the 'King of Cocaine' is no more|authors=Macias, Amanda Macias & Associated Press}}</ref>

Escobar also owned a huge Caribbean getaway on Isla Grande, the largest of the cluster of the 27 [[coral island|coral cluster island]]s comprising [[Islas del Rosario]], located about {{convert|22|miles|km}} from [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]. The compound, now half-demolished and overtaken by vegetation and wild animals, featured a mansion, apartments, courtyards, a large swimming pool, a helicopter landing pad, reinforced windows, tiled floors, and a large, unfinished building to the side of the mansion.<ref>{{cite news|work=Business Insider|author= Macias, Amanda |date=12 May 2016|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/caribbean-getaway-for-drug-kingpin-pablo-escobar-2015-9/#escobar-built-a-massive-waterfront-villa-on-the-largest-of-the-cluster-islands-isla-grande-2|title=Military & Defense: This dilapidated villa once served as a Caribbean getaway for drug-kingpin Pablo Escobar}}</ref>

Sixteen months after his escape from La Catedral, Pablo Escobar died in a shootout on 2 December 1993, amid another of his attempts to elude the [[Search Bloc]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-03/news/mn-63509_1_pablo-escobar |title=Colombia Drug Lord Escobar Dies in Shootout}} LA Times, 3 December 1993</ref> A Colombian electronic surveillance team, led by Brigadier Hugo Martínez,<ref>[http://www.faithtelegraph.com/interview-with-hugo-martinez-the-man-who-got-pablo-escobar/ Interview with Hugo Martinez – the man who 'got' Pablo Escobar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926153925/http://www.faithtelegraph.com/interview-with-hugo-martinez-the-man-who-got-pablo-escobar |date=26 September 2016 }} D.

The two fugitives attempted to escape by running across the roofs of adjoining houses to reach a back street, but both were shot and killed by Colombian National Police.<ref name="DEA"/> Escobar suffered gunshots to the leg and torso, and a fatal gunshot through the ear.

It has never been proven who actually fired the final shot into his ear, or determined whether this shot was made during the gunfight or as part of a possible execution, with wide speculation remaining regarding the subject. Some of Escobar's relatives believe that he had committed suicide.<ref name="DeathPablo"/><ref>{{YouTube|yVZoULtUCd8|Video of Escobar's exhumation}} {{in lang|es}}</ref> His two brothers, Roberto Escobar and Fernando Sánchez Arellano, believe that he shot himself through the ear.

''Zero Hour: Killing of the Cocaine King''.</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2016}}

==Aftermath of his death==
Soon after Escobar's death and the subsequent fragmentation of the Medellín Cartel, the cocaine market became dominated by the rival Cali Cartel until the mid-1990s when its leaders were either killed or captured by the Colombian government. The [[Robin Hood]] image that Escobar had cultivated maintained a lasting influence in Medellín. Many there, especially many of the city's poor whom Escobar had aided while he was alive, mourned his death, and over 25,000 people attended his funeral. Some of them consider him a saint and pray to him for receiving divine help.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-25183649 | title=Drug boss Pablo Escobar still divides Colombia| work=BBC News| date=2013-12-02| last1=Wallace| first1=Arturo}}</ref>

===Virginia Vallejo's testimony===
{{See also|Virginia Vallejo|Alberto Santofimio|Alfonso López Michelsen|Ernesto Samper|Álvaro Uribe}}
On 4 July 2006, [[Virginia Vallejo]], a television anchorwoman romantically involved with Escobar from 1983 to 1987, offered [[Office of the Attorney General of Colombia|Attorney General]] [[Mario Germán Iguarán Arana|Mario Iguarán]] her testimony in the trial against former Senator [[Alberto Santofimio]], who was accused of [[List of conspiracies (political)|conspiracy]] in the 1989 assassination of presidential candidate [[Luis Carlos Galán]]. Iguarán acknowledged that, although Vallejo had contacted his office on 4 July, the judge had decided to close the trial on 9 July, several weeks before the prospective closing date. The action was seen as too late.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://virginiavallejo.com/Attorney-General-on-VV-testimony.pdf|title=Colombian Attorney General on Virginia Vallejo's offer to testify against Santofimio|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301025436/http://virginiavallejo.com/Attorney-General-on-VV-testimony.pdf|archivedate=1 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Back to jail for Colombia ex-minister |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/world/back-to-jail-for-colombia-ex-minister-1129325 |work=Independent Online |location=Bogotá |date=1 September 2011 |access-date=2017-10-19}}</ref>

On 18 July 2006, Vallejo was taken to the United States on a special flight of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), for "safety and security reasons" due to her cooperation in high-profile criminal cases.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210828/http://www.virginiavallejo.com/herald-0716-2006.html|archivedate=17 July 2011|url-status=dead|url=http://www.virginiavallejo.com/herald-0716-2006.html|title=Virginia Vallejo takes refuge in United States|publisher=Virginia Vallejo}} reprinted and translated from {{cite news|title=Virginia Vallejo|date=16 July 2006|work=El Nuevo Herald|author=Gonzalo Guillen}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Jul18/0,4670,ColombiaEscobarapossLover,00.html|title=Pablo Escobar's Ex-Lover Flees Colombia|publisher=Fox News Channel}}</ref> On 24 July, a video in which Vallejo had accused Santofimio of instigating Escobar to eliminate presidential candidate Galán was aired by [[RCN Television]] of Colombia. The video was seen by 14 million people, and was instrumental for the reopened case of Galán's assassination. On 31 August 2011 Santofimio was sentenced to 24 years in prison for his role in the crime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radionizkor.org/colombia/vallejo.mp3|title=Testimony of Virginia Vallejo in 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radionizkor.org/colombia/index.html#vallejo|title=Radio Nizkor: Colombia.|website=www.radionizkor.org}}</ref>

====Role in the Palace of Justice siege====
Among Escobar's biographers, only Vallejo has given a detailed explanation of his role in the 1985 [[Palace of Justice siege]]. The journalist stated that Escobar had financed the operation, which was committed by [[19th of April Movement|M-19]]; but she blamed the army for the killings of more than 100 people, including 11 Supreme Court magistrates, M-19 members, and employees of the cafeteria. Her statements prompted the reopening of the case in 2008; Vallejo was asked to testify, and many of the events she had described in her book and testimonial were confirmed by Colombia's Commission of Truth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caracol.com.co/oir.aspx?id=659517|title=Virginia Vallejo testificó en el caso Palacio de Justicia|date=27 August 2008|publisher=Caracol Radio|author=Caracol Radio}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2009/12/17/truth-commission-blames-state-for-palace-of-justice-tragedy/|title=Truth Commission Blames Colombian State for Palace of Justice Tragedy|date=17 December 2009|publisher=UNREDACTED|author=Michael Evans}}</ref> These events led to further investigation into the siege that resulted with the conviction of a high-ranking former colonel and a former general, later sentenced to 30 and 35 years in prison, respectively, for the forced disappearance of the detained after the siege.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10280727|title=Colombia ex-officer jailed after historic conviction|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13245859|title=Colombian 1985 Supreme Court raid commander sentenced|work=BBC News}}</ref> Vallejo would subsequently testify in Galán's assassination.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?CategoryId=12393&ArticleId=337887|title=Galan Slaying a State Crime, Colombian Prosecutors Say|newspaper=Latin American Herald Tribune}}</ref> In her book, ''Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar'' ([[Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar]]), she had accused several politicians, including Colombian presidents [[Alfonso López Michelsen]], [[Ernesto Samper]] and [[Álvaro Uribe]] of having links to drug cartels.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/03/world/americas/03colombia.html?ex=1349150400&en=5b0977a0af0df0c6&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|title=Colombian Leader Disputes Claim of Tie to Cocaine Kingpin|last=Romero|first=Simon|date=3 October 2007|newspaper=The New York Times|page=1}}</ref> Due to threats, and her cooperation in these cases, on 3 June 2010 the United States granted political asylum to the Colombian journalist.

=== Relatives ===
Escobar's widow (María Henao, now María Isabel Santos Caballero), son (Juan Pablo, now [[Sebastián Marroquín|Juan Sebastián Marroquín Santos]]) and daughter (Manuela) fled Colombia in 1995 after failing to find a country that would grant them asylum.<ref name="BBCNovember1999">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/524276.stm|title=Drug lord's wife and son arrested|date=17 November 1999|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 February 2010}}</ref> Despite Escobar's numerous and continual infidelities, Maria remained supportive of her husband, though she urged him to eschew violence. Members of the Cali Cartel even replayed their recordings of her conversations with Pablo for their wives to demonstrate how a woman should behave.<ref>Page 466, ''Pablo Escobar, My Father.'' Escobar, Juan Pablo. St. Martin's Press, New York. 2014.</ref> This attitude proved to be the reason the cartel did not kill her and her children after Pablo's death, although the group demanded (and received) millions of dollars in reparations for Escobar's war against them. Henao even successfully negotiated for her son's life by personally guaranteeing he would not seek revenge against the cartel or participate in the drug trade.<ref>Pages 468-495, ''Pablo Escobar, My Father.''

Argentinian filmmaker Nicolas Entel's documentary ''[[Sins of My Father (film)|Sins of My Father]]'' (2009) chronicles Marroquín's efforts to seek forgiveness, on behalf of his father, from the sons of Rodrigo Lara, Colombia's justice minister who was assassinated in 1984, as well as from the sons of Luis Carlos Galán, the presidential candidate who was assassinated in 1989.

===Hacienda Nápoles===
After Escobar's death, the ranch, zoo and citadel at [[Hacienda Nápoles]] were given by the government to low-income families under a law called ''Extinción de Dominio'' (Domain Extinction). The property has been converted into a [[Amusement park|theme park]] surrounded by four luxury hotels overlooking the zoo.<ref name="BBCJune2008"/>

===Escobar Inc===
In 2014, Roberto Escobar founded Escobar Inc with Olof K.

===Hippos===
{{main|Pablo Escobar's hippos}}
Escobar kept four hippos in a private menagerie at Hacienda Nápoles. They were deemed too difficult to seize and move after Escobar's death, and hence left on the untended estate.

===Apartment demolition===
On 22 February 2019, at 11:53 AM local time, Medellín authorities demolished the six-story Edificio Mónaco apartment complex in the [[El Poblado]] neighborhood where, according to retired Colombian general [[Rosso José Serrano]], Escobar planned some of his most brazen attacks. The building was initially built for Escobar's wife but was gutted by a [[Cali Cartel]] [[car bomb]] in 1988 and had remained unoccupied ever since, becoming an attraction to foreign tourists seeking out Escobar's physical legacy. Mayor [[Federico Gutierrez]] had been pushing to raze the building and erect in its place a park honoring the thousands of cartel victims, including four presidential candidates and some 500 police officers. Colombian President [[Ivan Duque]] said the demolition "means that history is not going to be written in terms of the perpetrators but by recognizing the victims," hoping the demolition would showcase that the city had evolved significantly and had more to offer than the legacy left by the cartels.<ref>{{cite news|work=Fox News|url=https://www.foxnews.com/world/pablo-escobars-six-floor-apartment-demolished-in-medellin-as-symbol-of-rebirth|title=Pablo Escobar's six-floor apartment demolished in Medellin as symbol of rebirth|date=22 February 2019}}</ref>
