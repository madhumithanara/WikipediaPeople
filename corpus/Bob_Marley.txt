'''Robert Nesta Marley''', {{Post-nominals|country=JAM|post-noms=[[Order of Merit (Jamaica)|OM]]}} (6 February 1945&nbsp;– 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican singer, songwriter, and musician. Considered one of the pioneers of [[reggae]], his musical career was marked by fusing elements of reggae, [[ska]], and [[rocksteady]], as well as his distinctive vocal and songwriting style.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theculturetrip.com/caribbean/jamaica/articles/bob-marley-anatomy-of-an-icon/ |title=Bob Marley: Anatomy of an Icon |first=A.J. |last=Samuels |accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youthlinkjamaica.com/marley-new-view-cultural-icon |title='Marley' – a new view of a cultural icon |website=www.youthlinkjamaica.com |accessdate=10 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010104634/http://www.youthlinkjamaica.com/marley-new-view-cultural-icon |archive-date=10 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Marley's contributions to music increased the visibility of [[Jamaican music]] worldwide, and made him a global figure in [[popular culture]] for over a decade.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/news/bob-marley-biography-facts |title=7 Fascinating Facts About Bob Marley |accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref><ref name="Toynbee2013">{{cite book |first=Jason |last=Toynbee |title=Bob Marley: Herald of a Postcolonial World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BkDohE6Qd3oC&pg=PA1969 |accessdate=23 August 2013 |date=8 May 2013 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-7456-5737-0 |pages=1969– }}</ref> Over the course of his career Marley became known as a [[Rastafari]] icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality.<ref name= Masouri>{{cite book |first=Jon |last=Masouri |title=Wailing Blues&nbsp;– The Story of Bob Marley's Wailers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rq_7iIvMvYgC&pg=PT242 |accessdate=7 September 2013 |publisher=Music Sales Group |isbn=978-0-85712-035-9 |date=11 November 2009}}</ref> He is also considered a global symbol of [[Music of Jamaica|Jamaican music]] and [[Culture of Jamaica|culture]] and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for the legalization of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], while he also advocated for [[Pan-Africanism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/varun-soni/bob-marleys-spiritual-leg_b_453614.html |title=Bob Marley's Spiritual Legacy |first=Varun |last=Soni |website=huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=11 July 2017|date=2 July 2010 }}</ref>

Born in [[Nine Mile, Jamaica|Nine Mile]], [[British Jamaica]], Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]]. The group released its debut studio album ''[[The Wailing Wailers]]'' in 1965, which contained the single "[[One Love/People Get Ready]]"; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae.<ref name="Gooden2003">{{cite book |first=Lou |last=Gooden |title=Reggae Heritage: Jamaica's Music History, Culture & Politic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSbzpWSGkGUC&pg=PA293 |accessdate=25 August 2013 |year=2003 |publisher=AuthorHouse |isbn=978-1-4107-8062-1 |pages=293– }}</ref> The Wailers subsequently released eleven further studio albums; while initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with the singer's conversion to [[Rastafarianism]]. During this period Marley relocated to [[London]], and the group typified their musical shift with the release of the album ''[[The Best of The Wailers]]'' (1971).<ref>{{cite interview |url=http://www.reggae-vibes.com/concert/bunnylee/bunnylee2.htm |first=Bunny |last=Lee |title=Interview |work=Reggae Vibes |interviewer=Peter I. |date=23 August 2013}}</ref>

The group attained international success after the release of the albums ''[[Catch a Fire]]'' and ''[[Burnin' (The Wailers album)|Burnin']]'' (both 1973), and forged a reputation as touring artists. Following the disbandment of the Wailers a year later, Marley went on to release his solo material under the band's name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pureguitar.com/interviews/2013/02/19/aston-family-man-barrett-on-bass-with-bob-marley-peter-tosh-and-the-wailers/ |first=Aston "Family Man" |last=Barrett |title=Interview |work=Pure Guitar |date=19 February 2013 |accessdate=23 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206120731/http://pureguitar.com/interviews/2013/02/19/aston-family-man-barrett-on-bass-with-bob-marley-peter-tosh-and-the-wailers/ |archivedate=6 December 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> His debut studio album ''[[Natty Dread]]'' (1974) received positive reception, as did its follow-up ''[[Rastaman Vibration]]'' (1976). A few months after the album's release Marley [[Bob Marley assassination attempt|survived an assassination attempt]] at his home in Jamaica, which prompted him to permanently relocate to London. During his time in London he recorded the album ''[[Exodus (Bob Marley & the Wailers album)|Exodus]]'' (1977); it incorporated elements of [[blues]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[British rock]], enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success.

In 1977, Marley was diagnosed with [[acral lentiginous melanoma]]; he died as a result of the illness in 1981. His fans around the world expressed their grief, and he received a [[state funeral]] in Jamaica. The greatest hits album ''[[Legend (Bob Marley and the Wailers album)|Legend]]'' was released in 1984, and became the [[List of best-selling albums#20–29 million copies|best-selling reggae album of all time]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/deadly-profitable-the-13-highest-earning-dead-celebrities/article21112085/ |title=Deadly profitable: The 13 highest-earning dead celebrities |first=Amberly |last=Mcateer |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=15 October 2014 |accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref> Marley also ranks as one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]], with estimated sales of more than 75 million records worldwide.<ref name="Inc.2007">{{cite news |first=Patricia |last=Meschino |work=Billboard |title='Exodus' Returns |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lQ4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA42 |accessdate=23 August 2013 |date=6 October 2007 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |page=42 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> He was posthumously honored by Jamaica soon after his death with a designated [[Order of Merit (Jamaica)|Order of Merit]] by his nation.

Bob Marley and Neville Livingston (later known as [[Bunny Wailer]]) had been childhood friends in Nine Mile. They had started to play music together while at Stepney Primary and Junior High School.<ref>{{cite interview| first= Bunny| last= Wailer|url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201101/bunny-wailer-john-jeremiah-sullivan?currentPage=4 |title= The Last Wailer&nbsp;– Bunny Wailer interview| work= [[GQ]] |interviewer= John Jeremiah Sullivan| date= January 2011| accessdate= 22 October 2013}}</ref> Marley left Nine Mile with his mother when he was 12 and moved to [[Trenchtown]], Kingston.

Now that Marley and Livingston were living together in the same house in Trenchtown, their musical explorations deepened to include the latest R&B from United States radio stations whose broadcasts reached Jamaica, and the new ska music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jasobrecht.com/bob-marleys-early-years-miles-london/ |title= Bob Marley's Early Years: From Nine Miles To London| first= Jas| last= Obrecht |website= JasObrecht.com| accessdate= 8 November 2013}}</ref> The move to Trenchtown was proving to be fortuitous, and Marley soon found himself in a vocal group with Bunny Wailer, [[Peter Tosh]], [[Beverley Kelso]] and [[Junior Braithwaite]]. [[Joe Higgs]], who was part of the successful vocal act [[Higgs and Wilson]], resided on 3rd St., and his singing partner Roy Wilson had been raised by the grandmother of Junior Braithwaite. Higgs and Wilson would rehearse at the back of the houses between 2nd and 3rd Streets, and soon, Marley (now residing on 2nd St.), Junior Braithwaite and the others were congregating around this successful duo.<ref>{{cite interview|url=http://www.iration.com/juniorbraithwaite/jbinterview.html |first= Junior| last= Braithwaite |title= Interview | website= iration.com| date= 5 May 1985| interviewer= Roger Steffens| accessdate= 7 November 2013}}</ref> Marley and the others did not play any instruments at this time, and were more interested in being a vocal harmony group. Higgs was glad to help them develop their vocal harmonies, although more importantly, he had started to teach Marley how to play guitar—thereby creating the bedrock that would later allow Marley to construct some of the biggest-selling reggae songs in the history of the genre.<ref>{{cite web| first= Chuck| last= Foster|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/smallaxe/joe%20higgs.htm| title= Joe Higgs&nbsp;– No Man Could Stop The Source| website= Tiscali.co.uk| date= 12 November 2013| access-date= 12 November 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723001101/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/smallaxe/joe%20higgs.htm| archive-date= 23 July 2018| url-status= dead}}</ref><ref name= Pareles>{{cite news| first= Jon| last= Pareles|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/22/arts/joe-higgs-59-reggae-performer-taught-a-generation-of-singers.html |title= Joe Higgs, 59, Reggae Performer; Taught a Generation of Singers| work= [[The New York Times]]| date= 22 December 1999| accessdate= 12 November 2013}}</ref>

==Musical career==

===1962–72: Early years===
In February 1962, Marley recorded four songs, "[[Judge Not (song)|Judge Not]]", "One Cup of Coffee", "Do You Still Love Me?" and "Terror", at [[Ken Khouri|Federal Studios]] for local music producer [[Leslie Kong]].<ref>[http://www.wailer.de/?page_id=97 Bob Marley Solo, 1962] Wailer – The Bob Marley Compendium. Retrieved 8 November 2013.</ref> Three of the songs were released on [[Beverley's]] with "One Cup of Coffee" being released under the pseudonym Bobby Martell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobmarley.com/life/musicbusiness/beverley.html |title=The Beverley Label and Leslie Kong: Music Business|publisher=bobmarley.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621034903/http://www.bobmarley.com/life/musicbusiness/beverley.html |archivedate = 21 June 2006}}</ref>

In 1963, Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, Junior Braithwaite, Beverley Kelso, and [[Cherry Smith]] were called the Teenagers. They later changed the name to the Wailing Rudeboys, then to the Wailing Wailers, at which point they were discovered by record producer [[Coxsone Dodd]], and finally to the Wailers. Their single "[[Simmer Down]]" for the Coxsone label became a Jamaican No. 1 in February 1964 selling an estimated 70,000 copies.<ref name="Inc.1994">{{cite news| first= Don| last= Jeffrey| work= Billboard| title= Disputes Over Copyrights 'Scorch' Jamaican Reggae Artists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XwgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA92|date=16 July 1994|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page =92 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The Wailers, now regularly recording for Studio One, found themselves working with established Jamaican musicians such as [[Ernest Ranglin]] (arranger "It Hurts To Be Alone"),<ref name="Taylor">[http://unitedreggae.com/articles/n886/021112/interview-ernest-ranglin-part-1 Ranglin Interview with Angus Taylor (11 February 2011).] Retrieved 6 November 2013.</ref> the keyboardist [[Jackie Mittoo]] and saxophonist Roland Alphonso. By 1966, Braithwaite, Kelso, and Smith had left the Wailers, leaving the core trio of Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, and Peter Tosh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vitalspot.com/TheWailers/Biography.html|title=The Wailers' Biography|website= VitalSpot.com |accessdate=1 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910011258/http://www.vitalspot.com/TheWailers/Biography.html|archivedate=10 September 2007 }}</ref>

In 1966, Marley married [[Rita Marley|Rita Anderson]], and moved near his mother's residence in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in the United States for a short time, during which he worked as a [[DuPont]] lab assistant and on the assembly line at a [[Chrysler]] plant in nearby [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], under the alias Donald Marley.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6879720/bob_marley_19451981|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421114753/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6879720/bob_marley_19451981|archivedate=21 April 2009|title=Bob Marley: 1945–1981|work=Rolling Stone |date=25 June 1981|first=Timothy|last=White}}</ref>

Though raised as a Catholic, Marley became interested in [[Rastafari]] beliefs in the 1960s, when away from his mother's influence.<ref name= "Moskowitz Rebel16">{{cite book| first=David |last=Moskowitz|title= The Words and Music of Bob Marley| publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group| year= 2007| accessdate= 5 October 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QPZEqZHKq2AC&pg=PA16|page=16|isbn=9780275989354}}</ref> After returning to Jamaica, Marley formally converted to Rastafari and began to grow [[dreadlocks]].

After a financial disagreement with Dodd, Marley and his band teamed up with [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] and his studio band, [[the Upsetters]]. Although the alliance lasted less than a year, they recorded what many consider the Wailers' finest work. Marley and Perry split after a dispute regarding the assignment of recording rights, but they would continue to work together.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reggae's Mad Scientist |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/reggaes-mad-scientist-65011/ |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref>

1969 brought another change to Jamaican popular music in which the beat slowed down even further. The new beat was a slow, steady, ticking rhythm that was first heard on [[The Maytals]] song "[[Do the Reggay]]." Marley approached producer [[Leslie Kong]], who was regarded as one of the major developers of the [[reggae]] sound. For the recordings, Kong combined the Wailers with his studio musicians called [[Beverley's]] All-Stars, which consisted of the bassists Lloyd Parks and [[Jackie Jackson (bassist)|Jackie Jackson]], the drummer [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]], the keyboard players [[Gladstone Anderson]] and [[Winston Wright]], and the guitarists Rad Bryan, [[Lynn Taitt]], and Hux Brown.<ref name="Moskowitz Rebel23"/> As David Moskowitz writes, "The tracks recorded in this session illustrated the Wailers' earliest efforts in the new [[reggae]] style. Gone are the [[ska]] trumpets and saxophones of the earlier songs, with instrumental breaks now being played by the electric guitar." The songs recorded would be released as the album ''[[The Best of The Wailers]]'', including tracks "Soul Shakedown Party," "Stop That Train," "Caution," "Go Tell It on the Mountain," "Soon Come," "Can't You See," "Soul Captives," "Cheer Up," "Back Out," and "Do It Twice".<ref name="Moskowitz Rebel23">{{cite book| first=David |last=Moskowitz|title= The Words and Music of Bob Marley| publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group| year= 2007| accessdate= 5 October 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QPZEqZHKq2AC&pg=PA23|page=23}}</ref>

Between 1968 and 1972, Bob and Rita Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer re-cut some old tracks with [[JAD Records]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] and [[London]] in an attempt to commercialise the Wailers' sound. Bunny later asserted that these songs "should never be released on an album ... they were just demos for record companies to listen to". In 1968, Bob and Rita visited songwriter [[Jimmy Norman]] at his apartment in the Bronx. Norman had written the extended lyrics for Kai Winding's "Time Is on My Side" (covered by the Rolling Stones) and had also written for Johnny Nash and Jimi Hendrix.<ref name=Norman>{{cite news|title=Pre-reggae tape of Bob Marley is found and put on auction|first=Jesse|last=McKinley|date=19 December 2002|accessdate=4 January 2009|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/19/arts/pre-reggae-tape-of-bob-marley-is-found-and-put-on-auction.html}}</ref> A three-day jam session with Norman and others, including Norman's co-writer Al Pyfrom, resulted in a 24-minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman-Pyfrom's compositions.

In 1972, Bob Marley signed with [[CBS Records International|CBS Records]] in London and embarked on a UK tour with soul singer [[Johnny Nash]].<ref name="Bradley2001">{{cite book|first= Lloyd |last= Bradley|title=Bass Culture: When Reggae Was King|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_-j9ZUsSPsC&pg=PT522|date=30 August 2001|publisher=Penguin Adult| isbn= 978-0-14-023763-4|pages=522–}}</ref> While in London the Wailers asked their road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to [[Chris Blackwell]], who had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his [[Island Records]]. The Wailers intended to discuss the royalties associated with these releases; instead, the meeting resulted in the offer of an advance of £4,000 to record an album.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20110322/life/life2.html |first= Howard| last= Campbell| title= Bunny Wailer sets the record straight| work= The Gleaner| date= 22 March 2011| accessdate= 8 November 2013}}</ref> Since [[Jimmy Cliff]], Island's top reggae star, had recently left the label, Blackwell was primed for a replacement. In Marley, Blackwell recognised the elements needed to snare the rock audience: "I was dealing with rock music, which was really rebel music. I felt that would really be the way to break Jamaican music. But you needed someone who could be that image. When Bob walked in he really was that image."<ref name= savvy>{{cite news| title=Chris Blackwell: Savvy Svengali |date=February 2005 |url=http://exclaim.ca/Features/Timeline/chris_blackwell-savvy_svengalil |first=Brent |last=Hagerman |work=Exclaim.ca |accessdate=29 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427011209/http://exclaim.ca/|archivedate=27 April 2012}}</ref> The Wailers returned to Jamaica to record at Harry J's in Kingston, which resulted in the album ''[[Catch a Fire]]''.

Primarily recorded on an eight-track, ''Catch a Fire'' marked the first time a reggae band had access to a state-of-the-art studio and were accorded the same care as their rock 'n' roll peers.<ref name= savvy /> Blackwell desired to create "more of a drifting, hypnotic-type feel than a reggae rhythm",<ref>{{cite AV media notes| title= Catch a Fire| type= Liner notes |edition= 2001 reissue |work= Catch a Fire| first= Richard| last= Williams}}</ref> and restructured Marley's mixes and arrangements. Marley travelled to London to supervise Blackwell's overdubbing of the album which included tempering the mix from the bass-heavy sound of Jamaican music and omitting two tracks.<ref name= savvy />

The Wailers' first album for Island, ''Catch a Fire'', was released worldwide in April 1973, packaged like a rock record with a unique [[Zippo lighter]] lift-top. Initially selling 14,000 units, it received a positive critical reception.<ref name= savvy /> It was followed later that year by the album ''[[Burnin' (The Wailers album)|Burnin']]'' which included the song "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]". [[Eric Clapton]] was given the album by his guitarist [[George Terry (musician)|George Terry]] in the hope that he would enjoy it.<ref>{{cite interview |url=http://www.hit-channel.com/george-terry-eric-claptonfreddie-kingbee-geessolo/13618| first= George| last= Terry |title= Interview| work= Hit Channel| date= June 2011| accessdate= 10 November 2013}}</ref> Clapton was impressed and chose to record a [[cover version]] of "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]" which became his first US hit since "[[Layla]]" two years earlier and reached number 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 on 14 September 1974.<ref name="Inc.1974">{{cite news| work= Billboard| title= Billboard Hot 100 for week ending September 14, 1974 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64| publisher= Billboard Publications, Inc.| date=14 September 1974| page =64 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Many Jamaicans were not keen on the new reggae sound on ''Catch a Fire'', but the [[Trenchtown]] style of ''Burnin'' found fans across both reggae and rock audiences.<ref name= savvy />

During this period, Blackwell gifted his Kingston residence and company headquarters at 56 Hope Road (then known as Island House) to Marley. Housing Tuff Gong Studios, the property became not only Marley's office but also his home.<ref name= savvy />

The Wailers were scheduled to open 17 shows in the US for [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. After four shows, the band was fired because they were more popular than the acts they were opening for.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bobmarleytshirts.net/bob-marley-biography/ |title=Bob Marley Biography |publisher=admin |accessdate=4 December 2016 |date=9 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426152041/http://bobmarleytshirts.net/bob-marley-biography/ |archivedate=26 April 2016 }}</ref> The Wailers disbanded in 1974, with each of the three main members pursuing a solo career.

===1974–76: Line-up changes and shooting===

Despite the break-up, Marley continued recording as "Bob Marley & The Wailers". His new [[Wailers Band|backing band]] included brothers [[Carlton Barrett|Carlton]] and [[Aston Barrett|Aston "Family Man" Barrett]] on drums and bass respectively, [[Junior Marvin]] and [[Al Anderson (The Wailers)|Al Anderson]] on lead guitar, [[Tyrone Downie]] and [[Earl Lindo|Earl "Wya" Lindo]] on keyboards, and [[Alvin "Seeco" Patterson]] on percussion. The "[[I Threes]]", consisting of [[Judy Mowatt]], [[Marcia Griffiths]], and Marley's wife, Rita, provided backing vocals. In 1975, Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, with a live version of "[[No Woman, No Cry]]", from the ''[[Live! (Bob Marley & the Wailers album)|Live!]]'' album.<ref name="Inc.1975">{{cite news| work= Billboard| title= Billboard Hits of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA69|accessdate=8 September 2013|date=15 November 1975|publisher= Billboard Publications, Inc.|page =69 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> This was followed by his breakthrough album in the United States, ''[[Rastaman Vibration]]'' (1976), which reached the Top 50 of the Billboard Soul Charts.<ref name="Inc.1976">{{cite news| work= Billboard| title= Soul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT77|accessdate=2 September 2013|date=25 December 1976|publisher= Billboard Publications, Inc.| page = 77 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

On 3 December 1976, two days before "[[Smile Jamaica Concert|Smile Jamaica]]", a free concert organised by the [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|Jamaican Prime Minister]] [[Michael Manley]] in an attempt to ease tension between two warring political groups, Marley, his wife, and manager Don Taylor were wounded in an assault by unknown gunmen inside Marley's home. Taylor and Marley's wife sustained serious injuries but later made full recoveries. Bob Marley received minor wounds in the chest and arm.<ref name= "Moskowitz Rebel71">{{cite book| first=David |last=Moskowitz|title= The Words and Music of Bob Marley| publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group| year= 2007| accessdate= 5 October 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QPZEqZHKq2AC&pg=PA71|pages=71–73|isbn=9780275989354}}</ref> The attempt on his life was thought to have been politically motivated, as many felt the concert was really a support rally for Manley<!--Manley is correct, do not change it to Marley-->. Nonetheless, the concert proceeded, and an injured Marley performed as scheduled, two days after the attempt. When asked why, Marley responded, "The people who are trying to make this world worse aren't taking a day off. How can I?" The members of the group [[Zap Pow]] played as Bob Marley's backup band before a festival crowd of 80,000 while members of The Wailers were still missing or in hiding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/rs230-bob-marley/|title=Rolling Stone #230: Bob Marley &#124; The Uncool – The Official Site for Everything Cameron Crowe}}</ref><ref>Walker, Jeff (1980) on the cover of Zap Pow's LP ''Reggae Rules''.

===1976–79: Relocation to England===
Marley left Jamaica at the end of 1976, and after a month-long "recovery and writing" sojourn at the site of Chris Blackwell's [[Compass Point Studios]] in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], Bahamas, arrived in England, where he spent two years in self-imposed exile.

Whilst in England, he recorded the albums ''[[Exodus (Bob Marley & The Wailers album)|Exodus]]'' and ''[[Kaya (album)|Kaya]]''. ''Exodus'' stayed on the British album charts for 56 consecutive weeks. It included four UK hit singles: "Exodus", "Waiting in Vain", "Jamming", and "[[One Love (Bob Marley song)|One Love]]" (which interpolates [[Curtis Mayfield]]'s hit, "[[People Get Ready]]"). During his time in London, he was arrested and received a conviction for [[Drug possession|possession]] of a small quantity of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdfield.com/new/timeline.html|title=A Timeline of Bob Marley's Career|publisher=Thirdfield.com|accessdate=3 October 2009}}</ref> In 1978, Marley returned to Jamaica and performed at another political concert, the [[One Love Peace Concert]], again in an effort to calm warring parties. Near the end of the performance, by Marley's request, Michael Manley (leader of then-ruling [[People's National Party]]) and his political rival [[Edward Seaga]] (leader of the opposing [[Jamaica Labour Party]]) joined each other on stage and shook hands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1307397|title=One Love Peace Concert|publisher=Everything2.com|date=24 May 2002|accessdate=3 October 2009}}</ref>

Under the name Bob Marley and the Wailers 11 albums were released, four live albums and seven studio albums. The releases included ''[[Babylon by Bus]]'', a double live album with 13 tracks, were released in 1978 and received critical acclaim. This album, and specifically the final track "Jamming" with the audience in a frenzy captured the intensity of Marley's live performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/301860 |title=Babylon by Bus review |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=3 October 2009 |date=28 December 1978 |first=Timothy |last=White |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216193915/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/301860 |archivedate=16 February 2009 }}</ref>

===1979–81: Later years===
''[[Survival (Bob Marley & The Wailers album)|Survival]]'', a defiant and politically charged album, was released in 1979. Tracks such as "Zimbabwe", "[[Africa Unite]]", "Wake Up and Live", and "Survival" reflected Marley's support for the struggles of Africans. His appearance at the [[Amandla Festival]] in [[Boston]] in July 1979 showed his strong opposition to South African [[apartheid]], which he already had shown in his song "[[War (Bob Marley song)|War]]" in 1976. In early 1980, he was invited to perform at 17 April celebration of [[Zimbabwe]]'s Independence Day.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hans |first1=Thobile |title=Remembering Bob Marley at the Birth of Zimbabwe |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesinternational/2015/04/02/remembering-bob-marley-at-the-birth-of-zimbabwe/ |accessdate=25 November 2018 |work=Forbes |date=2 April 2015 |language=en}}</ref>

''[[Uprising (Bob Marley & The Wailers album)|Uprising]]'' (1980) was Bob Marley's final studio album, and is one of his most religious productions; it includes "Redemption Song" and "[[Forever Loving Jah]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/103460/review/6068123 |title=Uprising review |work=Rolling Stone |first=Chris |last=Morris |date=16 October 1980 |accessdate=3 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024024740/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/103460/review/6068123 |archivedate=24 October 2007 }}</ref> ''[[Confrontation (Bob Marley & the Wailers album)|Confrontation]]'', released posthumously in 1983, contained unreleased material recorded during Marley's lifetime, including the hit "[[Buffalo Soldier (song)|Buffalo Soldier]]" and new mixes of singles previously only available in Jamaica.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bobmarley/albums/album/232098/review/6067472/confrontation|title=Confrontation review|work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=3 October 2009|date=1 September 1983|first=Fred|last=Schruers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225051939/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bobmarley/albums/album/232098/review/6067472/confrontation|archivedate=25 February 2007 }}</ref>

In July 1977, Marley was found to have a [[acral lentiginous melanoma|type of malignant melanoma]] under the nail of a toe. Contrary to [[urban legend]], this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year but was instead a symptom of already-existing cancer. He had to see two doctors before a biopsy was made, which confirmed the deadliest kind of skin cancer: [[acral lentiginous melanoma]]. Unlike other melanomas, usually on skin exposed to the sun, acral lentiginous melanoma occurs in places that are easy to miss, such as the soles of the feet, or under toenails. Although it is the commonest melanoma in people with dark skin, it is not widely recognised, and was not mentioned in the most popular medical textbook of the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/13/decolonising-dermatology-why-black-and-brown-skin-need-better-treatment |title=Decolonising dermatology: why black and brown skin need better treatment |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Neil Singh |date= 13 August 2020}}</ref>

Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead, the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft was taken from his thigh to cover the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune242.com/04122011_Bob-Marley_features_pg9|title=A Death by Skin Cancer?

The album ''[[Uprising (Bob Marley and the Wailers album)|Uprising]]'' was released in May 1980. The band completed a major tour of Europe, where it played its biggest concert to 100,000 people in Milan, Italy. After the tour Marley went to the United States, where he performed two shows at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City as part of the [[Uprising Tour]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Bob Marley hired Gambino mobsters for protection in New York |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/bob-marley-hired-gambino-mobsters-protection-new-book-claims-article-1.3311553 |accessdate=2 December 2018 |publisher=New York Daily News |date=8 July 2017}}</ref> He collapsed while jogging in Central Park and was taken to hospital, where it was found that his cancer had spread to his brain, lungs, and liver.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bob Marley |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/people/bobmarley.shtml |website=BBC Religions |date=21 October 2009}}</ref>

Marley's last concert took place two days later at the Stanley Theater (now The [[Benedum Center]] For The Performing Arts) in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, on 23 September 1980.

The only known photographs from the show were included in [[Kevin Macdonald (director)|Kevin Macdonald's]] documentary film ''[[Marley (film)|Marley]]''.<ref name="Scott2012">{{cite web

Shortly afterward, Marley's health deteriorated as his cancer had [[Metastasis|spread throughout his body]]. The rest of the tour was canceled and Marley sought treatment at the clinic of [[Josef Issels]] in [[Bavaria]], Germany, where he underwent an [[alternative cancer treatment]] called [[Issels treatment]] partly based on avoidance of certain foods, drinks, and other substances. After eight months of effectively failing to treat his advancing cancer, Marley boarded a plane for his home in Jamaica.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.bobmarley.com/story/?storypage=7 |title=His story: The life and legacy of Bob Marley |website= BobMarley.com |accessdate=4 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417040043/http://web.bobmarley.com/story/?storypage=7 |archivedate=17 April 2009 }}</ref> During the flight Marley's vital functions worsened. After landing in Miami, Florida, he was taken to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital (later [[Jackson Memorial Hospital|University of Miami Hospital]]) for immediate medical attention, but died on 11 May 1981, aged 36, due to the spread of melanoma to his lungs and brain.

On 21 May 1981, Jamaican Prime Minister [[Edward Seaga]] delivered the final funeral [[eulogy]] to Marley, saying:

Internationally, Marley's message also continues to reverberate among various [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous communities]].

Marley evolved into a global symbol, which has been endlessly merchandised through a variety of mediums. In light of this, author [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]] in his book ''Reggae and Caribbean Music'', laments what he perceives to be the commercialised pacification of Marley's more militant edge, stating:

{{quote|Bob Marley ranks among both the most popular and the most misunderstood figures in modern culture ... That the machine has utterly emasculated Marley is beyond doubt. Gone from the public record is the ghetto kid who dreamed of [[Che Guevara]] and the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], and pinned their posters up in the Wailers Soul Shack record store; who believed in freedom; and the fighting which it necessitated, and dressed the part on an early album sleeve; whose heroes were [[James Brown]] and [[Muhammad Ali]]; whose God was [[Haile Selassie I|Ras Tafari]] and whose sacrament was [[marijuana]]. Instead, the Bob Marley who surveys his kingdom today is smiling benevolence, a shining sun, a waving palm tree, and a string of hits which tumble out of polite radio like candy from a gumball machine. Of course it has assured his [[immortality]]. But it has also demeaned him beyond recognition. Bob Marley was worth far more.<ref>''Reggae and Caribbean Music'', by [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]], [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], 2002, {{ISBN|0-87930-655-6}}, pp. 159</ref>}}

Several film adaptations have evolved as well. For instance, a feature-length documentary about his life, ''Rebel Music'', won various awards at the [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]. With contributions from Rita, The Wailers, and Marley's lovers and children, it also tells much of the story in his own words.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.amazon.com/Rebel-Music-The-Marley-Story/dp/B00005KA71 | title=Rebel Music – The Bob Marley Story | date=2001 | medium=Rita Marley, Bob Marley}}</ref> In February 2008, director [[Martin Scorsese]] announced his intention to produce a documentary movie on Marley.

== Personal life ==

=== Religion ===
Bob Marley was a member for some years of the [[Rastafari movement]], whose culture was a key element in the development of reggae. He became an ardent proponent of Rastafari, taking its music out of the socially deprived areas of Jamaica and onto the international music scene. He once gave the following response, which was typical, to a question put to him during a recorded interview:

{{quote|
'''Interviewer:''' "Can you tell the people what it means being a Rastafarian?"
<br />
'''Marley:''' "I would say to the people, Be still, and know that His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia is the Almighty.  Now, the Bible seh so, Babylon newspaper seh so, and I and I the children seh so. Yunno? So I don't see how much more reveal our people want. Wha' dem want? a white god, well God come black. True true."<ref name= "Davis Biography">{{cite book| publisher= Littlehampton Book Services Ltd| date= 28 July 1983| isbn= 978-0213168599| last= Davis| first= Stephen| title= Bob Marley: the biography| url-access= registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bobmarleybiograp00davi}}</ref>{{rp|115}}}}

[[Archbishop]] [[Abuna Yesehaq]] baptised Marley into the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], giving him the name Berhane Selassie, on 4 November 1980, shortly before his death.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVhrAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT114|title=No Woman, No Cry: My Life with Bob Marley|authorlink=Rita Marley|first=Rita|last=Marley|isbn=9781401305697|date=5 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Catch A Fire: The Life of Bob Marley |authorlink=Timothy White (editor)|first=Timothy|last=White|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8W50pUs1twC&printsec=frontcover&dq=behane+marley+catch+fire%23#v=snippet&q=berhane|isbn=9780857121363|date=7 January 2010}}</ref>

=== Family ===
Bob Marley married [[Rita Marley|Alpharita Constantia "Rita" Anderson]] in Kingston, Jamaica, on 10 February 1966.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BkDohE6Qd3oC&pg=PT88|title=Bob Marley: Herald of a Postcolonial World|first= Jason  |last=Toynbee|page=88|year=2013|quote= Rita has claimed that she was raped there [Bull Bay] by Bob in 1973 after he returned from London, and asked her to care for another child he was going to have by a woman there (Roper 2004). The formulation changes to 'almost raped' in her autobiography (Marley 2005: 113). But in any event, it seems clear that Bob behaved in an oppressive way towards her, always providing financial support for herself and the children it is true, yet frequently humiliating and bullying her.|isbn=9780745657370}}</ref> Marley had many children: four with his wife Rita, two adopted from Rita's previous relationships, and several others with different women. The official Bob Marley website acknowledges 11 children.

=== Personal views ===

==== Pan-Africanism ====
Marley was a [[Pan-African]]ist and believed in the unity of African people worldwide. His beliefs were rooted in his Rastafari religious beliefs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bobmarley.com/history/|title=History|website=Bob Marley}}</ref> He was substantially inspired by [[Marcus Garvey]], and had anti-imperialist and pan-Africanist themes in many of his songs, such as "[[Zimbabwe (song)|Zimbabwe]]", "Exodus", "Survival", "Blackman Redemption", and "[[Redemption Song]]". "Redemption Song" draws influence from a speech given by Marcus Garvey in Nova Scotia, 1937.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Natural Mystics: Marley, Tosh, and Wailer|last=Grant|first=Colin|page=113}}</ref> Marley held that independence of African countries from European domination was a victory for all those in the African diaspora. In the song "Africa Unite", he sings of a desire for all peoples of the African diaspora to come together and fight against "Babylon"; similarly, in the song "Zimbabwe", he marks the liberation of the whole continent of Africa, and evokes calls for unity between all Africans, both within and outside Africa.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Thomas L.|title=Sound, Society and the Geography of Popular Music|page=100}}</ref>

==== Cannabis ====
{{See also|Rastafari and cannabis}}
Marley considered [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] a healing herb, a "sacrament", and an "aid to medication"; he supported the legalisation of the drug.<ref name="Bob Marley: Musician">{{cite book|title=Bob Marley: Musician|first1= Sherry| last1= Paprocki| first2=Sean |last2= Dolan|page=51}}</ref> He thought that marijuana use was prevalent in the Bible, reading passages such as [[Psalm 104|Psalms 104:14]] as showing approval of its usage.<ref name="Bob Marley: Musician"/> Marley began to use cannabis when he converted to the Rastafari faith from [[Catholicism]] in 1966. He was arrested in 1968 after being caught with cannabis but continued to use marijuana in accordance with his religious beliefs. Of his marijuana usage, he said, "When you smoke herb, herb reveal yourself to you. All the wickedness you do, the herb reveal itself to yourself, your conscience, show up yourself clear, because herb make you meditate. Is only a natural t'ing and it grow like a tree."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cannabis: A History| last=Booth|first=Martin|pages=366, 367, 368}}</ref> Marley saw marijuana usage as a vital factor in religious growth and connection with Jah, and as a way to philosophise and become wiser.<ref name= "Moskowitz Biography15">{{cite book|first=David |last=Moskowitz|title=Bob Marley: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNv2XuFP2-QC&pg=PR15|page=15|accessdate=10 September 2013|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33879-3}}</ref>
