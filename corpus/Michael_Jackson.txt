'''Michael Joseph Jackson''' (August 29, 1958{{spnd}}June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer.<!--DO NOT add more occupations per [[Talk:Michael Jackson/Archive 31#Lead sentence format]]--> Dubbed the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|King of Pop]]", he is regarded as one of the [[Cultural impact of Michael Jackson|most significant cultural figures]] of the 20th century. Through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance techniques such as the [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]], to which he gave the name. His sound and style have [[List of artists influenced by Michael Jackson|influenced artists of various genres]], and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in [[popular culture]] for over four decades. Jackson is the [[List of awards and nominations received by Michael Jackson|most awarded artist in the history of popular music]].

The eighth child of the [[Jackson family]], Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]], and [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]] as a member of [[the Jackson 5]]. Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at [[Motown|Motown Records]], and rose to solo stardom with his fifth studio album ''[[Off the Wall]]'' (1979) during the peak of the [[Disco#1977–1979: Pop preeminence|disco era]]. By the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in [[popular music]]. His [[music video]]s, including those for "[[Beat It]]", "[[Billie Jean]]", and "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]" from his sixth studio album ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' (1982), are credited with breaking [[Anti-black racism in the United States|racial barriers]] and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. Jackson's prominence propelled him and the television channel [[MTV]] into cultural phenomenons of [[1980s#Popular culture|1980s pop culture]]. At the [[26th Annual Grammy Awards|1984 Grammy Awards]], ''Thriller'' won a record-breaking eight [[Grammy Award]]s, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year#Recipients|Album of the Year]]. Jackson continued to innovate with videos on the [[List of best-selling albums|global best-seller albums]] ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' (1987), ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'' (1991) and ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]]'' (1995). 

Starting in the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his [[Health and appearance of Michael Jackson|changing appearance]], [[Personal relationships of Michael Jackson|relationships]], behavior and lifestyle. In 1993, he was [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|accused of sexually abusing the child]] of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of court, and Jackson was not indicted. In 2005, he was [[Trial of Michael Jackson|tried and acquitted]] of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. In 2009, while preparing for a series of comeback concerts, ''[[This Is It (concert residency)|This Is It]]'', [[Death of Michael Jackson|Jackson died]] from an overdose of [[propofol]] administered by his personal physician, [[Conrad Murray]]. Fans around the world expressed their grief, and Jackson's [[Michael Jackson memorial service|public memorial service]] was broadcast live. In August 2009, the [[Los Angeles County Coroner]] ruled that Jackson's death was a [[homicide]], and [[California v. Murray|Murray was convicted]] of [[involuntary manslaughter]] in November 2011. Seven years later, the documentary ''[[Leaving Neverland]]'', which detailed posthumous allegations of child sexual abuse, led to another media backlash against Jackson.

The release of ''Invincible'' was preceded by a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had expected the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him in the early 2000s, after which he would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits, but clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.{{sfn|Taraborrelli|2009|pp=610–611}} ''Invincible'' was released on October 30, 2001.

In 1984, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' pop critic [[Jay Cocks]] wrote that "Jackson is the biggest thing since the Beatles. He is the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley.

Pop critic [[Robert Christgau]] wrote that Jackson's work from the 1970s to the early 1990s showed "immense originality, adaptability, and ambition" with "genius beats, hooks, arrangements, and vocals (though not lyrics)", music that "will stand forever as a reproach to the puritanical notion that pop music is slick or shallow and that's the end of it". During the 1990s, as Jackson lost control of his "troubling life", his music suffered and began to shape "an arc not merely of promise fulfilled and outlived, but of something approaching tragedy: a phenomenally ebullient child star tops himself like none before, only to transmute audibly into a lost weirdo".<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Robert |last= Christgau |authorlink= Robert Christgau |title= Michael Jackson: 'The Ultimate Collection' |magazine= [[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |date= December 2004 |accessdate= March 12, 2019 |url= http://robertchristgau.com/xg/cdrev/jackson,m-ble.php}}</ref> In the 2000s, Christgau wrote: "Jackson's obsession with fame, his grotesque life magnified by his grotesque wealth, are such an offense to rock aesthetes that the fact that he's a great musician is now often forgotten".<ref>{{cite news|first= Robert |last= Christgau |title= Consumer Guide: Popstakes |newspaper= [[The Village Voice]] |date= January 15, 2002 |accessdate= March 12, 2019 |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv102-02.php}}</ref>

===Vocal style===
Jackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style changed. Between 1971 and 1975, his voice descended from boy [[soprano]] to high [[tenor]].{{sfn|Brackett|Hoard|2004|p=414}} He was known for his vocal range.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= 100 Greatest Singers of All Time |magazine= Rolling Stone |date= December 3, 2010 |accessdate= April 14, 2019 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-147019/michael-jackson-18-223970/}}</ref> With the arrival of ''Off the Wall'' in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; ''Rolling Stone'' compared his vocals to the "breathless, dreamy stutter" of Stevie Wonder, and wrote that "Jackson's feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling [[falsetto]] that's used very daringly."<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Stephen |last= Holden |authorlink= Stephen Holden |title= Michael Jackson: Off The Wall |magazine= Rolling Stone |date= November 1, 1979 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/off-the-wall-19791101}}</ref> By the time of 1982's ''Thriller'', ''Rolling Stone'' wrote that Jackson was singing in a "fully adult voice" that was "tinged by sadness".<ref name="Thriller"/>

The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the introspective album ''Dangerous''. ''The New York Times'' noted that on some tracks, "he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" and he had a "wretched tone". When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to "smooth" vocals.<ref name="NYT Dangerous"/> Of ''Invincible'', ''Rolling Stone'' wrote that, at 43, Jackson still performed "exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies".<ref>{{cite magazine|first= James |last= Hunter |title= Michael Jackson: Invincible |magazine= Rolling Stone |date= December 6, 2001 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/invincible-20011206}}</ref> [[Joseph Vogel]] notes Jackson's ability to use non-verbal sounds to express emotion.{{sfn|Vogel|2012|p=9}} [[Neil McCormick]] wrote that Jackson's unorthodox singing style "was original and utterly distinctive".<ref>{{cite news|first= Neil |last= McCormick |authorlink= Neil McCormick |title= Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen & Bono |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |date= June 30, 2009 |accessdate= February 16, 2016 |url= http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/neilmccormick/100000966/michael-jackson-bruce-springsteen-bono-great-singing-is-about-more-than-the-notes/}}</ref>

===Musicianship===
Jackson had no formal music training and could not read or write [[Musical notation|music notation]]. He is credited for playing guitar, keyboard and drums, but was not proficient in them.<ref name="NME">{{cite magazine|first= Lucy |last= Jones |title= The Incredible Way Michael Jackson Wrote Music |magazine= [[NME]] |date= April 2, 2014 |accessdate= April 26, 2016 |url= https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/the-incredible-way-michael-jackson-wrote-music/}}</ref> When composing, he recorded ideas by beatboxing and imitating instruments vocally.<ref name="NME"/> Describing the process, he said: "I'll just sing the bass part into the tape recorder. I'll take that bass lick and put the chords of the melody over the bass lick and that's what inspires the melody." Engineer Robert Hoffman recalled Jackson dictating a guitar chord note by note and singing string arrangements part by part into a cassette recorder.<ref name="NME"/>

With ''Off the Wall'', Jackson's "vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides" vividly showed his maturation into an adult, [[Robert Christgau]] wrote in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "oddball" music personas: "Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed."{{sfn|Christgau|1981|loc=Consumer Guide '70s: J}} With ''Thriller'', Christopher Connelly of ''Rolling Stone'' commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of [[paranoia]] and darker imagery.<ref name="Thriller"/> AllMusic's [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] noted this on the songs "Billie Jean" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'".<ref name="AMThriller"/> In "Billie Jean", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child,<ref name="allmusic"/> and in "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" he argues against gossip and the media.<ref name="Thriller"/> "Beat It" decried gang violence in a homage to ''[[West Side Story]]'', and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="Bio"/> He also observed that the title track "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the [[supernatural]], a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem "We Are the World"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.<ref name="allmusic"/>
