'''Justin Drew Bieber''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|b|ər}}; born March 1, 1994) is a Canadian singer and songwriter.<!--NOTE: He is NOT a singer-songwriter, he is a singer and a songwriter.

With Bieber's debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[My World (EP)|My World]]'', released in late 2009, Bieber became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut record chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/02/05/earlyshow/leisure/music/main6177327.shtml|title=Justin Bieber Fever Hits Miami |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=February 5, 2010|accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref>

Bieber released his debut studio album ''[[My World 2.0]]'' in 2010. Containing the hit single "[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]", the album debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making Bieber the youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years.<ref name=":4" /> Following his debut album and promotional tours, he released his 3D biopic-concert film ''[[Justin Bieber: Never Say Never]]'', which was a box office success. In the years after the releases of the ''[[Under the Mistletoe]]'' (2011) and ''[[Believe (Justin Bieber album)|Believe]]'' (2012), Bieber had established himself as a [[teen idol]], but faced several controversies, including run-ins with the law internationally before his first arrest in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why is Justin Bieber both Famous and Infamous?|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/why-is-justin-bieber-both-famous-and-infamous-2011-11|last=Kaushik|first=Preetam|website=Business Insider|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>

Following controversies surrounding Bieber, his sound became more mature as he transitioned into [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and moved away from teen pop.<ref>{{cite web|title=Justin Bieber Could Never Be the King of EDM, But These Are Some Great Remixes|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2014/03/justin-bieber-edm-remixes/|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref> Released in 2015, his fourth studio album ''[[Purpose (Justin Bieber album)|Purpose]]'' became his most commercially successful album, spawning three [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles: "[[What Do You Mean?]]", "[[Sorry (Justin Bieber song)|Sorry]]", and "[[Love Yourself]]". After the release of ''Purpose,'' Bieber had featured on several successful collaborations, including "[[Cold Water (song)|Cold Water]]", "[[Let Me Love You (DJ Snake song)|Let Me Love You]]", "[[Despacito (Justin Bieber song)|Despacito (Remix)]]", "[[I'm the One (DJ Khaled song)|I'm the One]]", "[[I Don't Care (Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber song)|I Don't Care]]" and "[[10,000 Hours (song)|10,000 Hours]]", all of which went top five in the US. After taking some time off to focus on his marriage to [[Hailey Baldwin]], Bieber released his fifth studio album, ''[[Changes (Justin Bieber album)|Changes]]'', which became his seventh chart-topper in the US.

When searching for videos of a different singer, [[Scooter Braun]], a former marketing executive of [[So So Def Recordings]], clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 [[YouTube]] videos by accident.<ref name="nyimage"/> Impressed, Braun tracked down the theatre Bieber was performing in, located Bieber's school, and finally contacted Mallette, who was reluctant because of Braun's Judaism. She remembered praying, "God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!", and, "God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?" However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun. At 13, Bieber went to [[Atlanta]], Georgia, with Braun to record demo tapes.<ref name="nyimage"/> Bieber began singing for [[Usher (singer)|Usher]] one week later.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://neonlimelight.com/2009/08/11/neon-limelight-interviews-usher-protege-justin-bieber-accidental-star/ |title=Neon Limelight Interviews: Usher Protegé Justin Bieber: Accidental Star|work= Neon Limelight |author= TJ|date= August 11, 2009|accessdate=August 11, 2009}}</ref>

Usher commented that while he and Bieber were both signed at the same age, "I had the chance to ramp up my success, where this has happened to Bieber abruptly". As a result, when he was younger, Usher, Braun, Bieber's bodyguard, and other adults surrounding Bieber constantly coached him on handling fame and his public image.<ref name = "nyimage" /> After signing Bieber, Usher appointed one of his former assistants, Ryan Good, to be Bieber's [[road manager]] and [[Personal stylist|stylist]]. Good, once nicknamed Bieber's "swagger coach", created a "streetwise look" for the singer which consisted of baseball caps, hoodies, dog chains, and flashy sneakers. Amy Kaufman of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' comments, "Though a product of a middle-class suburban upbringing in [[Stratford, Ontario]], Bieber's manner of dress and speech ('Wassup man, how you doin'?' or 'It's like, you know, whateva' ') suggest he's mimicking his favourite rappers."<ref name="kaufman">{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Amy|url=https://azcentral.com/thingstodo/music/articles/2010/04/13/20100413justin-bieber-tour.html|title=Adults work hard to manage Justin Bieber's image|publisher=Azcentral|date=April 13, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}</ref> In 2013, Bieber said he was "very influenced by [[African-American culture|black culture]]", but he neither thought "of it as black or white" nor tried to "act or pose in a certain way". To him, it was "a lifestyle—like a suaveness or a [[wikt:swag#Etymology 2|swag]]".<ref name=willsmith/> Wax statues of him with the hairstyle from his early career are on display at the [[Madame Tussauds]] wax museums in New York City, London, and Amsterdam.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1659922/justin-bieber-wax-figure.jhtml |title=Justin Bieber Wax Figures Unveiled|publisher=MTV|date= March 15, 2011|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}</ref>
