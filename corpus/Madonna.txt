'''Madonna Louise Ciccone''' ({{IPAc-en|tʃ|ɪ|ˈ|k|oʊ|n|i}}; {{IPA-it|tʃikˈkoːne|lang}}; born August 16, 1958) is an American singer-songwriter, actress, author, and record executive.<!--Only the most notable occupations associated with her, other less notable occupations should be listed in the infobox. --> Having been referred to as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Pop]]" since the 1980s, she is regarded as one of the [[Cultural impact of Madonna|most impactful figures in popular culture]]. Madonna is noted for her continual reinvention and versatility in music production, songwriting, and visual presentation. She has pushed the boundaries of [[artistic freedom|artistic expression]] in mainstream music, while remaining completely in charge of every aspect of her career. Her works, which incorporate social, political, sexual, and religious themes, have generated both critical acclaim and controversy. Madonna is often cited as an influence by [[List of artists influenced by Madonna|other artists]].

Born and raised in [[Michigan]], Madonna moved to [[New York City]] in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands [[Breakfast Club (band)|Breakfast Club]] and Emmy, Madonna signed with [[Sire Records]] in 1982 and released her [[Madonna (Madonna album)|eponymous debut album]] the next year. She followed it with a series of [[Madonna albums discography|successful albums]], including all-time bestsellers ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' (1984) and ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'' (1986) as well as [[Grammy Award]] winners ''[[Ray of Light]]'' (1998) and ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' (2005). Madonna has attained many [[Madonna singles discography|number-one singles]] throughout her career, including "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]", "[[La Isla Bonita]]", "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]", "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]", "[[Take a Bow (Madonna song)|Take a Bow]]", "[[Frozen (Madonna song)|Frozen]]", "[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]", "[[Hung Up]]", and "[[4 Minutes]]".

Madonna's popularity was further enhanced by [[Madonna filmography|roles in films]] such as ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'' (1985), ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1990), ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' (1992), and ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'' (1996). While ''Evita'' earned her a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], many of her other films received poor reviews. As a businesswoman, Madonna founded an entertainment company called [[Maverick (company)|Maverick]] (including the label Maverick Records) in 1992. Her other ventures include [[Madonna fashion brands|fashion brands]], [[Madonna bibliography|children's books]], [[Hard Candy Fitness|health clubs]], and filmmaking. She contributes to various charities, having founded Ray of Light Foundation in 1998 and [[Raising Malawi]] in 2006.

Having sold over 300 million records worldwide<!--Do ''not'' change without consensus on talk page-->, Madonna is certified as the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling female music artist of all time]] by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. She is the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones|most successful solo artist]] in the history of the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and holds the [[List of Madonna records and achievements|record for the most number-one singles]] by a female artist in [[List of artists who reached number one on the Australian singles chart|Australia]], [[List of artists by number of Canadian number-one singles (RPM)|Canada]], [[List of artists who reached number one on the Italian Singles Chart|Italy]], [[List of artists who reached number one on the Spanish Singles Chart|Spain]], and the [[List of artists by number of UK Singles Chart number ones|United Kingdom]]. With a revenue of U.S. $1.4&nbsp;billion from her concert tickets, she remains the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing solo touring artist of all time]]. Madonna was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2008, her first year of eligibility. She was ranked as the [[The Greatest (TV series)|greatest woman in music]] by [[VH1]] in 2012, and as the greatest music video artist of all time by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' in 2020. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' also listed Madonna among the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]] and the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]].

==Life and career==
===1958–1981: Early life and career beginnings===
Madonna Louise Ciccone was born to Catholic parents Madonna Louise ([[née]] Fortin; 1933–1963) and Silvio Anthony "Tony" Ciccone<ref name="mom"/> in [[Bay City, Michigan]], on August 16, 1958.<ref name=allmusicbio>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/madonna-mn0000237205/biography|title=Madonna Biography|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=April 13, 2015|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref> Her father's parents were Italian emigrants from [[Pacentro]], while her mother was of French-Canadian descent.<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=10}}</ref> Tony worked as an engineer designer for [[Chrysler]] and [[General Motors]]. Since Madonna had the same name as her mother, family members called her "Little Nonnie".<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=2}}</ref> Madonna later commented about her name, "How could I be anything else but what I am having been named Madonna? I would either have ended up a nun or this."<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=1}}</ref> She has two older brothers, Anthony and Martin, and three younger siblings, Paula, Christopher, and Melanie.<ref name="thechild">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1400097/The-child-who-became-a-star.html|title=The Child Who Became a Star: Madonna Timeline|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=July 26, 2006|accessdate=June 9, 2008}}</ref>

Upon being [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|confirmed]] in the [[Catholic Church]] in 1966, she adopted [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] as a [[confirmation name]].<ref>{{harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=92}}</ref> She was raised in the Detroit suburbs of [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] and Avon Township (now [[Rochester Hills, Michigan|Rochester Hills]]). Months before her mother died of [[breast cancer]] at age 30 on December 1, 1963, Madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality, although she did not understand the reason.<ref name="mom"/> Her mother was at a loss to explain her medical condition, and often began to cry when Madonna questioned her about it. Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=47}}</ref>

Madonna turned to her paternal grandmother for solace. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and rebelled against anyone brought into their home who they thought would try to take the place of their beloved mother. Madonna later told ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' that she saw herself in her youth as a "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades... I wanted to be somebody." Terrified that her father Tony could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him.<ref name="mom"/>

[[File:Madonna family in their vineyard cropped.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=The couple hugging and smiling|Madonna's stepmother and father, Joan and Tony Ciccone (2009)]]
In 1966, Tony married the family's housekeeper Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario.<ref name="thechild"/> Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him, which strained their relationship for many years afterward.<ref name="mom"/> She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high [[Grade (education)|grade point average]], and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. She would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the [[jungle gym|monkey bars]] during recess, and pull up her skirt during class—all so that the boys could see her underwear.<ref name="tarabio">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=23}}</ref>

Madonna's father put her in classical [[piano]] lessons, but she later convinced him to allow her to take [[ballet]] lessons.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=12}}</ref> Christopher Flynn, her ballet teacher, persuaded her to pursue a career in dance.<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|pp=26–29}}</ref> She later attended [[Rochester Adams High School]], where she became a straight-A student and a member of the cheerleading squad.<ref>{{harvnb|Claro|1994|pp=24, 27}}</ref> After graduating, she received a dance scholarship to the [[University of Michigan]] and studied over the summer at the [[American Dance Festival]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Tilden|first=Imogen |title=Madonna |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 4, 2001|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jul/04/netnotes.imogentilden|accessdate=May 29, 2008}}</ref><ref name= charlotteobserver/>

In 1978, Madonna dropped out of college and relocated to New York City.<ref>{{cite episode|title=A Star with Staying Power|url=http://edition.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/madonna/profile.html|year=2004|accessdate=April 22, 2015|series=People in the News|network=[[CNN]]|credits=Hosted by Paula Zahn}}</ref> She said of her move to New York, "It was the first time I'd ever taken a plane, the first time I'd ever gotten a taxi cab.

One night, while returning from a rehearsal, a pair of men held her at knifepoint and forced her to perform [[fellatio]]. She later found the incident to be "a taste of my weakness, it showed me that I still could not save myself in spite of all the strong-girl show. I could never forget it."<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=56}}</ref>

While performing as a backup singer and dancer for the French disco artist [[Patrick Hernandez]] on his 1979 world tour, Madonna became romantically involved with musician Dan Gilroy<ref name="tarabio"/> and they lived in an abandoned synagogue in [[Corona, Queens]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/hook-ups-break-ups/documentary-reveals-bedroom-tapes-madonna-made-with-lover/news-story/c488636c482dabb3d12ea63e688b15e1 |title=Documentary reveals bedroom tapes Madonna made with lover|date=August 14, 2016|accessdate=August 15, 2016|work=News.com.au}}</ref><ref name="goldmine">{{cite magazine|title=Madonna – From Genesis to Revelations|first=Bruce|last=Baron|magazine=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]|date=July 2, 1999|volume=25|issue=494|issn=1055-2685}}</ref> Together, they formed her first rock band, the [[Breakfast Club (band)|Breakfast Club]], for which Madonna sang and played drums and guitar.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=23}}</ref> In 1980<ref name="thechild"/> or 1981<ref name="Rolling Biography">{{cite magazine|title=Biography – Madonna |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|year=2004|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/madonna/biography|accessdate=April 29, 2008|first=Caryn|last=Ganz}}</ref> she left Breakfast Club and, with her then boyfriend [[Stephen Bray]] as drummer, formed the band Emmy.

After Madonna signed a [[single (music)|singles]] deal with Sire, her debut single, "[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]", was released in October 1982, and the second, "[[Burning Up (Madonna song)|Burning Up]]", in March 1983.

Madonna's music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny. [[Robert M. Grant (economist)|Robert M. Grant]], author of ''Contemporary Strategy Analysis'' (2005), commented that what has brought Madonna success is "certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist, musician, dancer, songwriter, or actress, Madonna's talents seem modest."<ref name=CSA>{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=6}}</ref> He asserts Madonna's success is in relying on the talents of others, and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career.<ref name=CSA/> The author believed that Madonna's approach was far from the music industry wisdom of "Find a winning formula and stick to it". Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Grant concluded that "having established herself as the queen of popular music, Madonna did not stop there, but continued re-inventing."<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=3}}</ref> According to Thomas Harrison in the book ''Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties'', Madonna was "an artist who pushed the boundaries" of what a female singer could do, both visually and lyrically.<ref>{{harvnb|Harrison|2017|p=213}}</ref>

Throughout her career Madonna has been involved in writing and producing most of her own music.<ref name="music credit">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/madonna-mn0000237205/credits|title=Madonna > Credits|website=AllMusic|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}</ref> [[Stuart Price]], one of her past collaborators, said that "You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her.

Her second album, ''Like a Virgin'' (1984), foreshadowed several trends in her later works. It contained references to classical works ([[pizzicato]] synthesizer line that opens "[[Angel (Madonna song)|Angel]]"); potential negative reaction from social groups ("[[Dress You Up]]" was blacklisted by the [[Parents Music Resource Center]]); and retro styles ("Shoo-Bee-Doo", Madonna's homage to [[Motown]]).<ref name="fouzvocal">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hernández|Jarman-Ivens|2004|pp=59–61}}</ref>

===Influences===
According to Taraborrelli, the death of her mother had the most influence in shaping Madonna into the woman she would become. He believed that the devastation and abandonment Madonna felt at the loss of her mother taught her "a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own."<ref name="mom">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|pp=11–13}}</ref> Author [[Lucy O'Brien]] opines that the impact of the sexual assault Madonna suffered in her young adult years was the motivating factor behind everything she has done, more important than the death of her mother: "It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected. She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/madonna-like-an-icon-by-lucy-obrien-463929.html|title=Madonna: Like an Icon, By Lucy O'Brien|last=Burston|first=Paul|date=September 9, 2007 |accessdate=September 6, 2010|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928045808/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/madonna-like-an-icon-by-lucy-obrien-463929.html |archivedate=September 28, 2010}}</ref>

Madonna said that the first song to ever make a strong impression on her was "[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]" by [[Nancy Sinatra]]; she said it summed up her own "take-charge attitude".<ref name="hot"/> As a young woman, she attempted to broaden her taste in literature, art, and music, and during this time became interested in classical music.

===Music videos and performances===

In ''The Madonna Companion'' biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that more than any other recent pop artist, Madonna had used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work.<ref name="metz2">{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=161}}</ref> According to them, many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context, while referring to the music. Cultural critic [[Mark C. Taylor (philosopher)|Mark C. Taylor]] in his book ''Nots'' (1993) felt that the [[postmodern art]] form par excellence is video and the reigning "queen of video" is Madonna. He further asserted that "the most remarkable creation of MTV is Madonna. The responses to Madonna's excessively provocative videos have been predictably contradictory."<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1993|p=191}}</ref> The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as "Papa Don't Preach", "Like a Prayer", or "Justify My Love" had to do with the music videos created to promote the songs and their impact, rather than the songs themselves.<ref name="metz2"/> Morton felt that "artistically, Madonna's songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos."<ref name="morton20">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=20}}</ref> In 2003, MTV named her "The Greatest Music Video Star Ever" and said that "Madonna's innovation, creativity and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award."<ref>{{harvnb|Landrum|2007|p=258}}</ref> In 2020, ''Billboard'' ranked her atop the 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time.<ref>{{Cite web|date=August 27, 2020|title=The 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time: Staff List|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/9440075/100-best-music-video-artists|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827203952/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/9440075/100-best-music-video-artists|archive-date=August 27, 2020|accessdate=August 28, 2020|website=Billboard}}</ref>

Madonna's initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamor.<ref name="metz2"/> She was able to transmit her avant-garde downtown New York fashion sense to the American audience.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=163}}</ref> The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the ''True Blue'' era.<ref>{{harvnb|Fouz-Hernández|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=145}}</ref> Author [[Douglas Kellner]] noted, "such 'multiculturalism' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences."<ref>{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=271}}</ref> Madonna's Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time, in the form of boleros and layered skirts, accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of "La Isla Bonita".<ref>{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=44}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rettenmund|1995|p=34}}</ref> Academics noted that with her videos, Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex.<ref>{{harvnb|Welton|1998|p=234}}</ref> This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for "Like a Prayer". The video included scenes of an African-American church choir, Madonna being attracted to a statue of a black saint, and singing in front of burning crosses.<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=70}}</ref>

Madonna's performances on films have been frequently received negatively by film critics. Stephanie Zacharek stated in ''Time'' that, "[Madonna] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it's tough to watch, because she's clearly trying her damnedest." According to biographer [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]], "Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately she is deeply hurt." After the [[box office bomb]] ''Swept Away'' (2002), Madonna vowed that she would never again act in a film, hoping her repertoire as a bad actress would never be discussed again.<ref name="filmcareer">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=293}}</ref> In 2016, a career retrospective, titled ''Body of Work'', was shown at New York's Metrograph hall. According to ''The Guardian''{{'}}s Nigel M.

Chris Nelson from ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that "artists like Madonna and [[Janet Jackson]] set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing.

Metz noted that Madonna represents a [[paradox]] as she is often perceived as living her whole life as a performance. While her big-screen performances are panned, her live performances are critical successes.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=290}}</ref> Madonna was the first artist to have her concert tours as reenactment of her music videos. Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally, the fact that images from Madonna's videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the realism of the original videos. She believed that "her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized".<ref>{{harvnb|Diamond|1996|p=202}}</ref> Taraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia, latest technology and sound systems, Madonna's concerts and live performances are "extravagant show piece[s], [and] walking art show[s]."<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=90}}</ref> Madonna always films her concert tours, saying: "It's like documenting and archiving your artwork. It's a record of something I created with a lot of great and talented people... They're stages of my career, and they tell a story. They're an important part of my legacy, so I'm documenting them," she explained. Madonna has expressed her desire to create a stripped-down, acoustic only concert "that continues to involve music and dance [but also] poetry and humor". She also wanted to involve water elements in her productions but had been discouraged due to logistical problems.<ref name="ewtrump"/>
