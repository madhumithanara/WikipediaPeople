'''Michael Gerard Tyson''' (born June 30, 1966) is an American former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1985 to 2005. He reigned as the [[undisputed champion|undisputed]] world [[heavyweight]] champion from 1987 to 1990 and was the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]], [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], and [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] titles, as well as the only heavyweight to successively unify them. Claiming his first belt at 20 years, four months, and 22 days old, Tyson holds the record as the youngest boxer to win a heavyweight title.<ref>{{cite web|title=At only 20 years of age, Mike Tyson became the youngest heavyweight boxing champion of the world|url=https://miketysonlive.com/about/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217131716/http://miketysonlive.com/about/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 17, 2015|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref> 

Tyson won his first 19 professional fights by [[knockout]], 12 of them in the first round. He won the WBC title in 1986 after stopping [[Trevor Berbick]] in the second round, and added the WBA and IBF titles after defeating [[James Smith (boxer)|James Smith]] and [[Tony Tucker]] in 1987. The following year, Tyson became the [[lineal champion]] when he knocked out [[Michael Spinks]] in 91 seconds of the first round.<ref name=CBZ>{{cite web|title="Iron" Mike Tyson|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/tysonrec.htm|publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}</ref> He successfully defended his titles nine times, which included victories over [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Frank Bruno]]. In 1990, Tyson lost the titles to underdog [[Buster Douglas]], who knocked him out in the tenth round. Attempting to regain the titles, Tyson defeated [[Donovan Ruddock]] twice in 1991, but pulled out of a fight with then-undisputed heavyweight champion [[Evander Holyfield]] (who had defeated Douglas later in 1990) due to a rib injury.

In 1992, Tyson was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison, although he was released on parole after three years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holley|first=David|date=September 16, 2005|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/16/world/fg-tyson16|title=Tyson a Heavyweight in Chechnya|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ntv.ru/video/73193/ "Майк Тайсон в гостях у Рамзана Кадырова (видео)"] (in Russian).

After his release in 1995, he engaged in a series of comeback fights. He won the WBC and WBA titles in 1996, after stopping [[Frank Bruno]] and [[Bruce Seldon]]. With his defeat of Bruno, Tyson joined [[Floyd Patterson]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Tim Witherspoon]], [[Evander Holyfield]], and [[George Foreman]] as the only men in boxing history to have regained a heavyweight championship after losing it. After being stripped of the WBC title in the same year, Tyson [[Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield|lost the WBA title to Evander Holyfield]] by an eleventh round stoppage. Their [[Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II|1997 rematch]] ended when Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield's ears.

In 2002, Tyson fought for the world heavyweight title again at the age of 35, losing by knockout to [[Lennox Lewis]]. Tyson retired from professional boxing in 2006, after being knocked out in consecutive matches against [[Journeyman (boxing)|journeymen]] [[Danny Williams (boxer)|Danny Williams]] and [[Kevin McBride]]. Tyson declared bankruptcy in 2003, despite having received over $30&nbsp;million for several of his fights and $300&nbsp;million during his career. At the time the media reported that he had approximately $23 million in debt.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sandomir|first=Richard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/05/sports/tyson-s-bankruptcy-is-a-lesson-in-ways-to-squander-a-fortune.html|title=Tyson's Bankruptcy Is a Lesson In Ways to Squander a Fortune|date=August 5, 2003|newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=December 7, 2015}}</ref>

As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], Tyson won gold medals at the 1981 and 1982 Junior Olympic Games, defeating Joe Cortez in 1981 and beating Kelton Brown in 1982.

===Rise to stardom===

Tyson made his professional debut as an 18-year-old on March 6, 1985, in [[Albany, New York]]. He defeated Hector Mercedes via first-round TKO.<ref name="espn1" /> He had 15 bouts in his first year as a professional. Fighting frequently, Tyson won 26 of his first 28 fights by KO or TKO; 16 of those came in the first round.<ref name="rec_0">[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/tysonrec.htm "Iron" Mike Tyson], ''Cyberboxingzone.com Boxing record''. Retrieved April 27, 2007.</ref> The quality of his opponents gradually increased to [[Journeyman (boxing)|journeyman]] fighters and borderline contenders,<ref name="rec_0" /> like [[James Tillis]], [[David Jaco]], [[Jesse Ferguson]], [[Mitch Green]], and [[Marvis Frazier]]. His win streak attracted media attention and Tyson was billed as the next great [[heavyweight]] champion. D'Amato died in November 1985, relatively early into Tyson's professional career, and some speculate that his death was the catalyst to many of the troubles Tyson was to experience as his life and career progressed.<ref>Hornfinger, [http://www.saddoboxing.com/boxing-article/Cus-Damato-Mike-Tyson.html Cus D'Amato], ''SaddoBoxing.com''.

Tyson's first nationally [[television|televised]] bout took place on February 16, 1986, at [[Houston Field House]] in [[Troy, New York]] against journeyman heavyweight [[Jesse Ferguson]], and was carried by [[ABC Sports]]. Tyson knocked down Ferguson with an uppercut in the fifth round that broke Ferguson's nose.<ref>Oates, Joyce C., [http://jco.usfca.edu/boxing/tyson.html Mike Tyson], ''[[Life Magazine]] via author's website'', November 22, 1986. Retrieved March 11, 2007.</ref> During the sixth round, Ferguson began to hold and clinch Tyson in an apparent attempt to avoid further punishment. After admonishing Ferguson several times to obey his commands to box, the [[Referee (boxing)|referee]] finally stopped the fight near the middle of the sixth round. The fight was initially ruled a win for Tyson by [[Disqualification (boxing)|disqualification]] (DQ) of his opponent. The ruling was "adjusted" to a win by [[technical knockout]] (TKO) after Tyson's corner protested that a DQ win would end Tyson's string of knockout victories, and that a knockout would have been the inevitable result.

In July, after recording six more knockout victories, Tyson fought former world title challenger [[Marvis Frazier]] in [[Glens Falls, New York]] on another ABC Sports broadcast. Tyson won easily, charging at Frazier at the opening bell and hitting him with an uppercut that knocked Frazier unconscious thirty seconds into the fight.

On November 22, 1986, Tyson was given his first title fight against [[Trevor Berbick]] for the [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC) heavyweight championship. Tyson won the title by TKO in the second round, and at the age of 20 years and 4 months became the youngest heavyweight champion in history.<ref>Pinnington, Samuel., [http://www.britishboxing.net/news_2062-Trevor-Berbick-The-Soldier-of-the-Cross.html Trevor Berbick&nbsp;– The Soldier of the Cross] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204021613/http://www.britishboxing.net/news_2062-Trevor-Berbick-The-Soldier-of-the-Cross.html |date=February 4, 2007 }}, ''Britishboxing.net'', January 31, 2007.

On June 27, 1988, Tyson faced [[Michael Spinks]]. Spinks, who had taken the heavyweight championship from [[Larry Holmes]] via fifteen-round decision in 1985, had not lost his title in the ring but was not recognized as champion by the major boxing organizations. Holmes had previously given up all but the IBF title, and that was eventually stripped from Spinks after he elected to fight Gerry Cooney (winning by TKO in the fifth round) rather than IBF Number 1 Contender Tony Tucker, as the Cooney fight provided him a larger purse. However, Spinks did become the lineal champion by beating Holmes and many (including [[The Ring (magazine)|''Ring'']] magazine) considered him to have a legitimate claim to being the true heavyweight champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/crowning-recognizing-lineal-champion-part-i--18453|title=Crowning and Recognizing A Lineal Champion|publisher=BoxingScene|author=Jake Donovan}}</ref> The bout was, at the time, the richest fight in history and expectations were very high. Boxing pundits were predicting a titanic battle of styles, with Tyson's aggressive infighting conflicting with Spinks's skillful out-boxing and footwork. The fight ended after 91 seconds when Tyson knocked Spinks out in the first round; many consider this to be the pinnacle of Tyson's fame and boxing ability.<ref>Berger, Phil.

After the loss, Tyson recovered with first-round knockouts of [[Henry Tillman]]<ref>Berger, Phil (1990), "Tyson Wins in 1st Round", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late Edition-Final, Section 8, Page 7, Column 4'', June 17, 1990.</ref> and [[Alex Stewart (boxer)|Alex Stewart]]<ref>Berger, Phil (1990), "BOXING; Tyson Scores Round 1 Victory", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late Edition-Final, Section 8, Page 1, Column 5'', December 9, 1990.</ref> in his next two fights. Tyson's victory over Tillman, the 1984 Olympic heavyweight gold medalist, enabled Tyson to avenge his amateur losses at Tillman's hands. These bouts set up an elimination match for another shot at the undisputed world heavyweight championship, which [[Evander Holyfield]] had taken from Douglas in his first defense of the title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing/buster-douglas-vs-evander-holyfield-it-was-the-last-great-heavyweight-title-fight-and-douglas-a6712526.html|title=Douglas vs Holyfield was the last great heavyweight title fight|date=October 28, 2015|work=The Independent}}</ref>

Tyson, who was the number one contender, faced number two contender [[Donovan Ruddock|Donovan "Razor" Ruddock]] on March 18, 1991, in Las Vegas. Ruddock was seen as the most dangerous heavyweight around and was thought of as one of the hardest punching heavyweights. Tyson and Ruddock went back and forth for most of the fight, until referee [[Richard Steele (referee)|Richard Steele]] controversially stopped the fight during the seventh round in favor of Tyson. This decision infuriated the fans in attendance, sparking a post-fight melee in the audience. The referee had to be escorted from the ring.<ref>Bellfield, Lee., [http://www.saddoboxing.com/939-boxing-history-mike-tyson-ruddock.html March 1991-Mike Tyson vs. Razor Ruddock], ''Saddoboxing.com'', March 13, 2005.

=={{anchor|Rape conviction and prison}}Rape conviction, prison, and conversion==
Tyson was arrested in July 1991 for the rape of 18-year-old Desiree Washington, [[Miss Black America|Miss Black Rhode Island]], in an [[Indianapolis]] hotel room. Tyson's rape trial took place in the [[Marion County, Indiana|Marion County]] superior court from January 26 to February 10, 1992.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shipp|first1=E.

Partial corroboration of Washington's story came via testimony from Tyson's chauffeur, Virginia Foster, who confirmed Desiree Washington's state of shock after the incident. Further testimony came from Thomas Richardson, the emergency room physician who examined Washington more than 24 hours after the incident and confirmed that Washington's physical condition was consistent with rape.<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Heller|title=Bad Intentions: The Mike Tyson Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQeJ5T9cGoAC&lpg=PA401&pg=PA414#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 29, 2013|date=August 21, 1995|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-80669-8|pages=414–}}</ref>

Under lead defense lawyer [[Vincent J. Fuller]]'s direct examination, Tyson claimed that everything had taken place with Washington's full consent and he claimed not to have forced himself upon her.

In January 1999, Tyson returned to the ring for a match against the South African [[Francois Botha]]. This match also ended in controversy. While Botha initially controlled the fight, Tyson allegedly attempted to break Botha's arms during a tie-up and both boxers were cautioned by the referee in the ill-tempered bout. Botha was ahead on points on all scorecards and was confident enough to mock Tyson as the fight continued. Nonetheless, Tyson landed a straight right hand in the fifth round that knocked out Botha.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/256442.stm Rusty Tyson finds the perfect punch], ''[[BBC]] News'', January 17, 1999.

Legal problems arose with Tyson once again. On February 5, 1999, Tyson was sentenced to a year's imprisonment, fined $5,000, and ordered to serve two years [[probation]] along with undergoing 200 hours of [[community service]] for assaulting two motorists after a traffic accident on August 31, 1998.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/272855.stm Tyson jailed over road rage], ''[[BBC]] News'', February 6, 1999.

Tyson once again had the opportunity to fight for a heavyweight championship in 2002. [[Lennox Lewis]] held the WBC, IBF, [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] and [[Lineal championship|Lineal]] titles at the time.

In another Memphis fight on February 22, 2003, Tyson beat fringe contender [[Clifford Etienne]] 49 seconds into round one. The pre-fight was marred by rumors of Tyson's lack of fitness. Some said that he took time out from training to party in Las Vegas and get a new facial [[tattoo]].<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/boxing/news/2003/0222/1513016.html Etienne's night ends 49 seconds into first round], ''AP via [[ESPN.com]]'', February 22, 2003.

On August 13, 2003, Tyson entered the ring for a face-to-face confrontation against [[K-1]] fighting phenom, [[Bob Sapp]], immediately after Sapp's win against [[Kimo Leopoldo]] in Las Vegas. K-1 signed Tyson to a contract with the hopes of making a fight happen between the two, but Tyson's felony history made it impossible for him to obtain a visa to enter Japan, where the fight would have been most profitable. Alternative locations were discussed, but the fight ultimately failed to happen.<ref>[http://www.tysontalk.com/article48.html K-1 Reports Official Mike Tyson Fight] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118123147/http://www.tysontalk.com/article48.html |date=November 18, 2011 }}.

On June 11, 2005, Tyson stunned the boxing world by quitting before the start of the seventh round in a close bout against journeyman [[Kevin McBride]]. In the 2008 documentary ''[[Tyson (2008 film)|Tyson]]'', he stated that he fought McBride for a payday, that he did not anticipate winning, that he was in poor physical condition and fed up with taking boxing seriously.
