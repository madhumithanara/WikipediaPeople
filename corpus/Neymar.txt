Neymar came into prominence at [[Santos FC|Santos]], where he made his professional debut aged 17. He helped the club win two successive [[Campeonato Paulista]] championships, a [[Copa do Brasil]], and the [[2011 Copa Libertadores]]; the latter being Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the [[South American Footballer of the Year]], in [[2011 South American Footballer of the Year|2011]] and [[2012 South American Footballer of the Year|2012]], and soon relocated to Europe to join [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. As part of Barcelona's attacking trio with [[Lionel Messi]] and [[Luis Suárez]], he won the [[Treble (association football)|continental treble]] of [[La Liga]], the [[Copa del Rey]], and the [[UEFA Champions League]], and finished third for the [[FIFA Ballon d'Or]] in [[2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or|2015]] for his performances. He then attained a [[Double (association football)|domestic double]] in the [[2015–16 FC Barcelona season|2015–16 season]]. In 2017, Neymar transferred from Barcelona to [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in a move worth €222&nbsp;million, making him [[List of most expensive association football transfers|the most expensive player ever]].{{refn|group=note|Although Barcelona did not classify Neymar's €222&nbsp;million buyout clause as a transfer fee, it was functionally identical to a transfer fee, since it cancelled his then-current contract with Barcelona (as in a typical transfer).

With 61 goals in 101 matches for Brazil since debuting at age 18, Neymar is the [[Brazil national football team#Top goalscorers|third highest goalscorer]] for his national team, trailing only [[Pelé]] and [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]. He was a key player in Brazil's victories at the [[2011 South American Youth Championship]], where he finished as leading goalscorer, and the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]], where he won the [[Golden Ball (FIFA Confederations Cup)|Golden Ball]] as player of the tournament. His participation in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and [[2015 Copa América]] was cut short by injury and a suspension, respectively, before captaining Brazil to their first Olympic gold medal in [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|men's football]] at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. Two years later, Neymar featured at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

Despite his first two seasons being highly successful, having ended the 2010 season with an impressive 42 goals in 60 games, problems had been identified, namely Neymar's apparent taste for diving when tackled, rather than attempting to continue his run, and his attitude. The latter came to the forefront during a match with [[Atlético Clube Goianiense|Atlético Goianiense]], on 15 September 2010, when the Santos' manager, [[Dorival Júnior]], appointed another player to take the penalty awarded for a foul on Neymar. His decision was based on the fact that Neymar had missed a crucial penalty during the [[Copa do Brasil 2010#Final phase|Copa do Brasil final]] of that year, even if Santos went on to win. Reacting to this, Neymar turned his back on his manager, had to be calmed down by a linesman and argued with his captain, [[Edu Dracena]]. The fallout from this event was that Dorival Júnior wished to have Neymar suspended for two weeks, but the board sided with the player and promptly sacked the manager. Despite Neymar's apologies over the incident, some doubts still remain about his attitude.<ref name="Back Page" /> In December 2010, aged just 18, Neymar came third for the [[2010 South American Footballer of the Year]], behind [[Andrés D'Alessandro]] and [[Juan Sebastián Verón]].<ref>[https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/30122010/2/d-alessandro-named-latin-america-player-year.html "D'Alessandro named Latin America player of the year"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523012746/https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/30122010/2/d-alessandro-named-latin-america-player-year.html |date=23 May 2014 }}.
