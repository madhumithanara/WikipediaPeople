Phelps set an [[Olympic record]] in the preliminary heats of the 400-meter individual medley.<ref>Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 45.</ref><ref>Schaller, p. 117.</ref> He followed that up in the final by winning the gold medal, as well as breaking his previous world record by nearly two seconds.<ref>Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 52.</ref><ref>Schaller, p. 129.</ref>

Phelps swam the first leg of the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in a time of 47.51 seconds (an American record for the 100-meter freestyle), and won his second gold medal of the 2008 Olympics, as well as setting his second world record of the Olympics (3:08.24).<ref>Schaller, p. 145.</ref> Teammate Jason Lezak, after beginning the anchor leg more than half a body length behind [[Alain Bernard]], managed to finish ahead of the favored French swimmer by eight hundredths of a second. The top five teams in the final finished ahead of the world record of 3:12.23 set the previous day by the American B team in a preliminary heat.<ref>Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 97.</ref> Phelps remarked that Bernard's pre-race comments of "smashing the Americans" had "fired me up more than anything else." ''Le Nouvel Observateur'' noted "Phelps taking the time to applaud and console Bernard" and wrote that this sportsmanship was "proof that the person who swims in the wake of Mark Spitz is also a great gentleman."<ref>Klein, Jeff Z., [http://beijing2008.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/11/what-the-world-is-saying-in-france-a-bitter-defeat-yes-but-no-mention-of-freedom-fries/?_r=0 "What the World Is Saying: In France, a Bitter Defeat, but No Mention of Freedom Fries"]. ''The News York Times'', August 11, 2008.</ref>

For his third race, Phelps broke his previous world record in the 200-meter freestyle by nearly a second and won his third gold medal. He also set his third world record at the Olympics, 1:42.96, winning by nearly two seconds over silver medalist [[Park Tae-hwan]].<ref>Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 129.</ref> In this race, Phelps became the fifth Olympic athlete in modern history to win nine gold medals, joining [[Mark Spitz]], [[Larisa Latynina]], [[Paavo Nurmi]], and [[Carl Lewis]].<ref>Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 130.</ref>

The next day, Phelps participated in two finals. In his first event, the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metre butterfly|200-meter butterfly]], Phelps made it four gold medals and world records in four events by swimming the final in 1:52.03, defeating silver medalist [[László Cseh]] by almost seven-tenths of a second despite his goggles' having filled up with water and being unable to "see anything for the last 100 meters.<ref>Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 151.</ref> This fourth gold medal was his tenth, and made him the all-time leader for most Olympic gold medals won by an individual in the modern Olympic era.<ref>Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 152.</ref> Moreover, Phelps became the first swimmer, male or female, to win three Olympic butterfly titles, after his two titles in the Athens 2004 Olympics. He also became the first swimmer to successfully defend an Olympic butterfly title.

Less than one hour after his gold medal victory in the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps swam the lead-off leg of the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. With Lochte, [[Ricky Berens]], and [[Peter Vanderkaay]], he won his fifth gold and set his fifth world record as the American team finished first with a time of 6:58.56. The Americans were the first team to break the seven-minute mark in the relay, and broke the previous record, set in Melbourne, Australia, by more than four and a half seconds.<ref>Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 176.</ref>

After taking a day off from finals (Phelps did swim in qualifying heats), Phelps won his sixth gold of the Beijing Games on August 15 by winning the 200-meter individual medley with a world record time of 1:54.23, finishing ahead of Cseh by over two seconds.<ref>Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 184.</ref>

=====Seventh gold medal=====
[[File:Phelps4x100.jpg|thumb|left|Phelps ''(in black cap)'' starting the 4x100m relay at the Beijing Olympic Games, August 11, 2008]]
Before the final of the 100-meter butterfly, US born Serbian swimmer [[Milorad Čavić]] caused a minor stir when he said it would be "good" if Phelps lost. "It'd be good for him if he loses. It would be nice if historians talk about Michael Phelps winning seven gold medals and losing the eighth to 'some guy.' I'd like to be that guy", Čavić said.<ref>Schaller, p. 174.</ref> Phelps responded, "When people say things like that, it fires me up more than anything."<ref>Schaller, p. 183.</ref> On August 16, Phelps won his seventh gold medal of the Games in the men's 100-meter butterfly, setting an Olympic record for the event with a time of 50.58 seconds and edging out his nearest competitor Čavić, by one hundredth (0.01) of a second.<ref>Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 206.</ref>

Unlike all six of his previous events in the 2008 Games, Phelps did not set a new world record, leaving intact [[Ian Crocker]]'s world-record time of 50.40 seconds, set in 2005.

Phelps's 0.01-second finish ahead of Čavić prompted the Serbian delegation to file a protest. Subsequent analysis of the video by the [[International Swimming Federation|FINA]] panel, which required analyzing frames shot 1/10,000th of a second apart, was used to officially confirm Phelps's victory,<ref>Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 207.</ref> but the images were not immediately released to the press. The initial refusal by official timekeeper Omega to release underwater photos of the finish also raised questions due to Phelps's sponsorship relationship with Omega.<ref>{{cite news |title=By Withholding Photos, Olympic Timekeeper Draws Attention to Relationship With Phelps |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/sports/olympics/21longman.html |work=The New York Times |date=August 20, 2008 |accessdate=June 13, 2010 |first=Jeré |last=Longman}}</ref> Čavić later wrote in his blog, "People, this is the greatest moment of my life.

Phelps's seventh gold medal of the Games tied [[Mark Spitz]]'s [[List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games|record]] for gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, set in the 1972 Olympics. It was also his fifth individual gold medal in Beijing, tying the [[List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games#List of most individual gold medals won at a single Olympic Games|record]] for individual gold medals at a single Games originally set by [[Eric Heiden]] in the 1980 Winter Olympics and equaled by [[Vitaly Scherbo]] at the 1992 Summer Games.

=====All-time record=====
On August 17, Phelps won his eighth gold medal in the 4×100-meter medley relay, breaking [[Mark Spitz]]'s record of seven gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, which had stood since 1972.<ref name="Phelps, No Limits, p. 218">Phelps, ''No Limits'', p. 218.</ref> Phelps, along with teammates [[Brendan Hansen]], [[Aaron Peirsol]], and Jason Lezak, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes and 29.34 seconds, 0.7 seconds ahead of second-place Australia and 1.34 seconds faster than the previous record set by the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. When Phelps dived in to swim the 100-meter butterfly leg, the third leg of the 400-meter medley, the United States had been trailing Australia and Japan. Phelps completed his split in 50.1 seconds, the fastest butterfly split ever for the event, giving teammate Jason Lezak a more than half-second lead for the final leg, which he held onto to clinch the event in world record time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Phelps claims Olympic-record eighth gold medal with relay win |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/08/16/bc.oly.swm.phelps.medley.relay.ap/ |work=Sports Illustrated |date=August 17, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412041039/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/08/16/bc.oly.swm.phelps.medley.relay.ap/ |archivedate=April 12, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Said Phelps, upon completing the event that awarded him his eighth gold medal and eighth Olympic record in as many events, "Records are always made to be broken no matter what they are ...

==World records==
Phelps has set 39 world records (29 individual, 10 relay), which is more records than any other swimmer that is recognized by [[FINA]]; this achievement surpassed [[Mark Spitz]]'s previous record of 33 world records (26 individual, 7 relay).{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2016}} However, [[Johnny Weissmuller]] is reported to have broken 67 official world records.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-swimming-blog/2013/nov/22/heroes-swimming-johnny-weissmuller |title=Heroes of swimming: Johnny Weissmuller |first1=Paul |last1=Mason |date=November 22, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=August 15, 2016}}</ref>

All but two of the records were set in a long-course (50-meter) pool. {{As of|2019|7|26|df=US}}, he holds four world records (indicated in '''bold'''), not including his records for most Olympic medals and most Olympic gold medals ever won by one person.
