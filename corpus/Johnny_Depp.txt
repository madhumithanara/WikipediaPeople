Although it was not a box office success upon its initial release,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} over the years it has gained [[cult film|cult classic]] status.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2010/09/16/cry-baby-depp-makes-the-girls-swoon/|title="Cry-Baby" Depp makes the girls swoon|work=Denver Post|first=Michael|last=Booth|date=September 16, 2010|access-date=June 26, 2018}}</ref>

He appeared in three films in 1993. In the romantic comedy ''[[Benny and Joon]]'', he played an eccentric and illiterate silent film fan who befriends a mentally ill woman and her brother; it became a [[sleeper hit]]. He then starred alongside [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Juliette Lewis]] in [[Lasse Hallström]]'s ''[[What's Eating Gilbert Grape]]'', a drama about a dysfunctional family. In his review of the film, Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said that "Depp manages to command center screen with a greatly affable, appealing characterization."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117902133.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|title=What's Eating Gilbert Grape Review|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|date=December 6, 1993|work=Variety|accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref> Depp's final 1993 release was [[Emir Kusturica]]'s [[surrealist]] comedy-drama ''[[Arizona Dream]]'', which opened to positive reviews.

In 1994, Depp reunited with director Tim Burton, playing the title role in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', a biographical film about one of history's most inept film directors.

The following year, Depp starred in three films. He played opposite [[Marlon Brando]] in the box-office hit ''[[Don Juan DeMarco]]'', as a man who believes he is [[Don Juan]], the world's greatest lover. He then starred in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Dead Man]]'', a [[Western (genre)|Western]] shot entirely in [[black-and-white]]; it was not a commercial success and had mixed critical reviews. Depp's final film of the year was in the financial and critical failure ''[[Nick of Time (film)|Nick of Time]]'', a thriller in which he played an accountant who is told to kill a politician to save his kidnapped daughter.

In 1997, Depp starred alongside [[Al Pacino]] in the crime drama ''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]'', directed by [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]]. He portrayed [[Joseph D. Pistone]], an undercover FBI Agent who assumes the name 'Donnie Brasco' in order to infiltrate [[American Mafia|the mafia]] in New York City. To prepare for the role, Depp spent time with the real-life Joe Pistone, on whose memoirs the film was based. ''Donnie Brasco'' was a commercial and critical success, and is considered to contain one of Depp's finest performances.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 1997, Depp also debuted as a director and screenwriter with ''[[The Brave (film)|The Brave]]''. He starred in it as a poor Native American man who accepts a proposal from a wealthy man, played by Marlon Brando, to appear in a [[snuff film]] in exchange for money for his family.

Depp was a fan and friend of writer [[Hunter S. Thompson]], and played his alter ego [[Raoul Duke]] in ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998), [[Terry Gilliam]]'s film adaptation of Thompson's pseudobiographical [[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas|novel of the same name]].{{efn| Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author's last book tours.<ref name="contactmusic">{{cite web |work=ContactMusic |title = Depp was ray for thompson book tour |url = http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/depp%20was%20ray%20for%20thompson%20book%20tour_1001455 |accessdate =July 3, 2006|date = July 3, 2006 }}</ref> In 2006, he contributed a foreword to ''Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S.

Depp's next venture with Burton was the period film ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1999), in which he played [[Ichabod Crane]] opposite [[Christina Ricci]] and [[Christopher Walken]]. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Roddy McDowall]] and [[Basil Rathbone]].{{sfn|Burton|Salisbury|2006|pp=177–178}} He stated that he "always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl."<ref>{{cite news |title=Johnny Depp on playing Ichabod Crane in ''Sleepy Hollow'' |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=May 2007 |url = https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20039648,00.html#20056052|accessdate=December 25, 2007}}</ref>

===Political and religious views===
Depp stated to the German magazine ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' in 2003 that "America is dumb, is something like a dumb puppy that has big teeth—that can bite and hurt you, aggressive."<ref name="Hindu" /> Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and his words were taken out of context, ''Stern'' stood by its story, as did [[CNN]].com in its coverage of the interview. CNN added his remark that he would like his children "to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out."<ref name="Silverman2003-09-03">

On the October 16, 2011, episode of ''[[Larry King Live]]'', when asked if he had faith, Depp replied, "Yes. I have faith in my kids.

In November 2016, Depp joined the campaign Imprisoned for Art to call for the release of Ukrainian filmmaker [[Oleg Sentsov]], who was being held in custody in Russia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/johnny-depp-supports-ukrainian-director-oleg-sentsov-imprisoned-art-campaign-948212 |title=Johnny Depp Supports Ukrainian Director Oleg Sentsov in "Imprisoned for Art" Campaign |website=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 17, 2016 |accessdate=February 18, 2019}}</ref>

At the [[Glastonbury Festival 2017]], Depp ranted against U.S. President [[Donald Trump]]. Depp controversially asked "When was the last time an actor assassinated a President?", before adding "I want to clarify: I'm not an actor. I lie for a living. However, it's been awhile and maybe it's time." He then said that he was "not insinuating anything". The comment seemed to reference [[John Wilkes Booth]], the actor who [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinated Abraham Lincoln]]. Shawn Holtzclaw of the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] told [[CNN]] that they were "aware" of Depp's comment, but said, "For security reasons, we cannot discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods of how we perform our protective responsibilities".<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/22/entertainment/johnny-depp-trump-comment-glastonbury/index.html Johnny Depp: 'When was the last time an actor assassinated a President?'], [[CNN]], June 23, 2016</ref><ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/johnny-depp-when-was-the-last-time-an-actor-assassinated-a-president-w489433 Johnny Depp: 'When Was the Last Time an Actor Assassinated a President?'], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', June 23, 2016</ref> The next day, Depp apologized for making these remarks, saying, "It did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice.
