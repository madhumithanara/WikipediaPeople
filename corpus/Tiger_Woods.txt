Following an outstanding junior, college, and amateur golf career, Woods turned professional in 1996 at the age of 20. By the end of April 1997, he had won three [[PGA Tour]] events in addition to his first major, the [[1997 Masters Tournament|1997 Masters]], which he won by 12 strokes in a record-breaking performance. He reached [[List of World Number One male golfers|number one]] in the [[Official World Golf Ranking|world rankings]] for the first time in June 1997, less than a year after turning pro. Throughout the first decade of the 21st century, Woods was the dominant force in golf.

The next decade of Woods's career was marked by comebacks from personal problems and injuries.

During the [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013 Masters]], Woods faced disqualification after unwittingly admitting in a post-round interview with [[ESPN]] that he had taken an illegal drop on the par-5 15th hole when his third shot had bounced off the pin and into the water. After further [[Trial by television in golf tournaments|review of television footage]], Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the drop but was not disqualified.<ref>{{cite web |title=Is Tiger Woods facing disqualification at Masters? |url=http://www.cbssports.com/golf/blog/eye-on-golf/22059739/is-tiger-woods-facing-disqualification-at-masters |publisher=CBS Sports |accessdate=April 13, 2013}}</ref> He finished tied for fourth in the event. Woods won [[The Players Championship]] in May 2013, his second career win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest he had gotten to four wins in any season in his professional career.

[[File:Tiger Woods 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Woods practicing in a bunker prior to the start of the 2014 [[Quicken Loans National]]]]
Woods had a poor showing at the [[2013 U.S. Open (golf)|2013 U.S. Open]] as a result of an elbow injury that he sustained at [[The Players Championship]]. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner [[Justin Rose]]. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the [[Greenbrier Classic]] and his own [[AT&T National]], he returned at the [[2013 Open Championship|Open Championship]] at [[Muirfield]]. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind [[Lee Westwood]], he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner [[Phil Mickelson]]. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the [[2013 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational|WGC-Bridgestone Invitational]], recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven-stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. But at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club, Woods never was in contention, making 2013 his fifth full season where he did not win a major; he was in contention in only two of the four majors in 2013.

After a slow start to 2014, Woods sustained an injury during the final round of the [[Honda Classic]] and was unable to finish the tournament. He withdrew after the 13th hole, citing back pain.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Tiger Woods walks off at Honda Classic |magazine=bunkered |date=March 3, 2014 |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/tiger-woods-walks-off-at-honda-classic |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> He subsequently competed in the [[WGC-Cadillac Championship]] but was visibly in pain during much of the last round. He was forced to skip the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]] at the end of March 2014,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Tiger Woods a doubt for the Masters |magazine=bunkered |date=March 19, 2014 |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/tiger-woods-a-doubt-for-the-masters |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> and after undergoing [[microdiscectomy|back surgery]], he announced on April 1 that he would miss the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] for the first time since 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Tiger Woods out of the Masters |magazine=bunkered |date=April 1, 2014 |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/tiger-woods-out-of-the-masters |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> Woods returned at the [[Quicken Loans National]] in June, however he said that his expectations for the week were low. He struggled with nearly every aspect of his game and missed the cut. He next played at [[The Open Championship]], contested at Hoylake, where Woods had won eight years prior. Woods fired a brilliant 69 in the first round to put himself in contention, but shot 77 on Friday and eventually finished 69th. Despite his back pain, he played at the [[2014 PGA Championship]] where he failed to make the cut. On August 25, 2014, Woods and his swing coach Sean Foley parted ways. In the four years under Foley, he won eight times but no majors. He had previously won eight majors with Harmon and six with Haney. Woods said there was currently no timetable to find a replacement swing coach.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2014/08/25/tiger-woods-sean-foley-coach-split/14561331/ |title=Tiger Woods splits with swing coach Sean Foley |newspaper=USA Today |date=August 25, 2014}}</ref>

In 2002, Woods was involved in every aspect of the launch of [[Buick]]'s [[Buick Rendezvous|Rendezvous]] [[SUV]]. A company spokesman stated that Buick was happy with the value of Woods's endorsement, pointing out that more than 130,000 Rendezvous vehicles were sold in 2002 and 2003.

In February 2007, Woods, [[Roger Federer]] and [[Thierry Henry]] became ambassadors for the "[[Global Gillette|Gillette]] Champions" marketing campaign.

In 1997, Woods and fellow golfer [[Arnold Palmer]] initiated a civil case against Bruce Matthews (the owner of Gotta Have It Golf, Inc.) and others in the effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. Matthews and associated parties counterclaimed that Woods and his company, ETW Corporation, committed several acts including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith, and violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.<ref>{{cite web |title=Palmer v.

===Tiger-proofing===
Early in Woods's career, a small number of golf industry analysts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of [[Knight Ridder]] asked in a column, "Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not).<ref name="Bad">{{cite news |title=Woods bad for golf? There's an unplayable lie |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |last=Lyon |first=Bill |date=August 16, 2000 }}</ref> At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.

A related effect was measured by [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] economist Jennifer Brown, who found that other golfers scored worse when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003–04. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a "superstar" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.<ref>Brown, Jennifer; [http://home.business.utah.edu/finmh/Brown_Quitters_Never_Win.pdf ''Quitters Never Win: The (Adverse) Incentive Effects of Competing with Superstars''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417030936/http://home.business.utah.edu/finmh/Brown_Quitters_Never_Win.pdf |date=April 17, 2012 }}, Job Market Paper, November 2007</ref>

Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like [[Augusta National Golf Club|Augusta National]]) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, in a strategy that became known as "Tiger-proofing".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harig |first1=Bob |title='Tiger-proofing' Augusta took a toll on all |url=https://www.espn.com/golf/masters11/columns/story?columnist=harig_bob&page=110329-RTTMasters |website=ESPN |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win.<ref name="Open2005">{{cite news|title=Tiger Woods Press Conference:The Open Championship |publisher=TigerWoods.com |agency=ASAP Sports |date=July 12, 2005 |url=http://www.tigerwoods.com/defaultflash.sps?page=fullstorynews&iNewsID=199184&categoryID=&pagenumber=1&cat=0 |accessdate=May 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316104728/http://www.tigerwoods.com/defaultflash.sps?page=fullstorynews&iNewsID=199184&categoryID=&pagenumber=1&cat=0 |archivedate=March 16, 2007}}</ref>

Woods has won 82 official [[PGA Tour]] events, including 15 [[Men's major golf championships|majors]]. He is 14–1 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead. Multiple golf experts have heralded Woods as "the greatest closer in history".<ref>

Despite his power advantage, Woods has always focused on developing an excellent all-around game. Although in recent years{{when|date=May 2017}} he has typically been near the bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.<ref name="linkageinc">{{cite web |title=Case Study: Tiger Woods |publisher=Linkage Incorporated |url=http://www.linkageinc.com/company/news_events/link_learn_enewsletter/archive/2002/03_02_case_study_tiger_woods.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015151438/http://www.linkageinc.com/company/news_events/link_learn_enewsletter/archive/2002/03_02_case_study_tiger_woods.aspx |archivedate=October 15, 2006 |accessdate=June 24, 2009}}</ref><ref name="par">{{cite web |title=When Par isn't good enough |website=APMP.org |url=http://www.apmp.org/fv-63.aspx |accessdate=May 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720081846/http://www.apmp.org/fv-63.aspx |archivedate=July 20, 2008}}</ref><ref name="CBS">{{cite news |title=Tiger Woods Up Close And Personal |publisher=[[CBS News]] |first=Ed |last=Bradley |date=September 3, 2006 |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/23/60minutes/main1433767_page5.shtml |accessdate=May 13, 2007}}</ref>

From mid-1993 (while he was still an amateur) until 2004, Woods worked almost exclusively with leading swing coach [[Butch Harmon]]. From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods's full swing, achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and better [[kinesiology]]. The changes began to pay off in 1999.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Pro: Lessons About Golf and Life from My Father, Claude Harmon, Sr. |last=Harmon |first=Butch |authorlink=Butch Harmon |year=2006 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |isbn=0-307-33804-5}}</ref> Woods and Harmon eventually parted ways. From March 2004 to 2010, Woods was coached by [[Hank Haney]], who worked on flattening his swing plane. Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy dropped significantly.

Tiger Woods Design has taken on two other courses, neither of which has materialized. In August 2007, Woods announced The Cliffs at High Carolina, a private course in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] near [[Asheville, North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Tiger to design his first U.S. course |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=2974491 |accessdate =August 15, 2007}}</ref> After a groundbreaking in November 2008, the project suffered cash flow problems and suspended construction.<ref name=sullivan/> A third course, in [[Punta Brava Golf Club|Punta Brava]], [[Mexico]], was announced in October 2008, but incurred delays due to issues with permits and an [[environmental impact study]].<ref name=sullivan/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Louis |first1=Brian |last2=Taub |first2=Daniel |title=Tiger Woods and Flagship to Build Mexico Golf Resort |publisher=Bloomberg |date=October 7, 2008 |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ao2vcPf3MUek&refer=us |accessdate=January 5, 2010}}</ref> Construction on the Punta Brava course has not yet begun.<ref name=sullivan/>

These projects have encountered problems that have been attributed to factors that include overly optimistic estimates of their value, declines throughout the global economy (particularly the [[United States housing bubble|U.S. crash in home prices]]), and the decreased appeal and marketability of Woods following his 2009 infidelity scandal.<ref name=sullivan/>
