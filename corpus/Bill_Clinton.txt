'''William Jefferson Clinton''' (''[[Birth name|né]]'' '''Blythe III'''; born August 19, 1946) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 42nd [[president of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001. Prior to his presidency, he served as [[governor of Arkansas]] (1979–1981 and 1983–1992) and as [[attorney general of Arkansas]] (1977–1979). A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was known as a [[New Democrats|New Democrat]], and many of his policies reflected a [[Centrism|centrist]] "[[Third Way]]" political philosophy. He is the husband of former secretary of state, former U.S. senator, and two-time [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign (disambiguation)|candidate]]<!--Intentional link to DAB page--> for president [[Hillary Clinton]].

Clinton was born and raised in [[Arkansas]] and attended [[Georgetown University]],<ref>{{cite web|title=William J. Clinton Biography and Interview |publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/william-j-clinton/#interview}}</ref> [[University College, Oxford]], and [[Yale Law School]]. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale and they were married in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive terms as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the [[National Governors Association]]. Clinton was elected president in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], defeating incumbent Republican opponent [[George H. W. Bush]]. At age 46, he became the [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|third-youngest president]] in history.

Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], but failed to pass his plan for [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|national health care reform]]. In the [[1994 United States elections|1994 elections]], the Republican Party [[Republican Revolution|won unified control]] of [[United States Congress|Congress]] for the first time in 40 years. In [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], Clinton became the first Democrat since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to be elected to a second full term. He passed [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|welfare reform]] and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], as well as financial deregulation measures. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] reported a budget surplus—the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the [[Bosnian War|Bosnian]] and [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]] wars, signed the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] in opposition to [[Saddam Hussein]], participated in the [[2000 Camp David Summit]] to advance the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli–Palestinian]] peace process, and assisted the [[Northern Ireland peace process]]. In 1998, [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|Clinton was impeached]] by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], becoming the second U.S. president to be impeached, after [[Andrew Johnson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeached.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage |last=Fandos |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Fandos |last2=Shear |first2=Michael D. |author2link=Michael D. Shear |date=December 18, 2019 |title=Trump Impeached for Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 19, 2019 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> The impeachment was based on accusations that Clinton committed [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] for the purpose of concealing his [[Lewinsky scandal|affair]] with [[Monica Lewinsky]], a 22-year-old [[White House Internship Program|White House intern]]. He was acquitted by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and completed his second term in office.

Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office [[approval rating]] of any U.S. president since [[World War II]], and has continually received high scores in [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|the historical rankings of U.S. presidents]]. Since leaving office, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the [[Clinton Foundation|William J. Clinton Foundation]] to address international causes such as the prevention of AIDS and [[global warming]]. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]''. In 2009, he was named the United Nations [[Special Envoy of the Secretary-General|Special Envoy]] to [[Haiti]] and after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], he teamed up with [[George W. Bush]] to form the [[Clinton Bush Haiti Fund]]. In addition, he secured the release of [[2009 imprisonment of American journalists by North Korea|two American journalists imprisoned by]] [[North Korea]], visiting the capital [[Pyongyang]] in 2009 and negotiating their release with then-North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]].

In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and [[Hot Springs High School (Arkansas)|Hot Springs High School]], where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.<ref name="My Life" /> Clinton was in the chorus and played the [[tenor saxophone]], winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section.

Clinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a [[Boys Nation]] senator to the [[White House]] to meet President [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref name="My Life" /><ref name="First in His Class" /> The other was watching [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s 1963 "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech on TV, which impressed him so much that he later memorized it.<ref>{{cite web | title=It All Began in a Place Called Hope (Archived whitehouse.gov Article) | publisher=[[The White House]] | url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html | accessdate=August 30, 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719152125/http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html | archivedate=July 19, 2011 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==College and law school years==

===Georgetown University===

[[File:Clinton at Georgetown 1967.jpg|thumb|upright|Clinton ran for president of the [[Georgetown University Student Association|Student Council]] while attending the School of Foreign Service at [[Georgetown University]].]]

With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the [[School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C., receiving a [[List of tagged degrees|Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service]] degree in 1968.

In 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for [[class president]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert E.

===Oxford===

Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[University College, Oxford]], where he initially read for a [[B.Phil.]] in [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics|philosophy, politics, and economics]] but transferred to a [[B.Litt.]] in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics.<ref name="Hoffman">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/the-bill-clinton-we-knew-at-oxford-apart-from-smoking-dope-and-not-inhaling-what-else-did-he-learn-1556769.html|title=The Bill Clinton we knew at Oxford: Apart from smoking dope (and not inhaling), what else did he learn over here?

During his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a [[Draft lottery (1969)|draft]] letter that mandated deployment to the [[Vietnam War]]. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton.<ref name="Hoffman"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/22/magazine/most-likely-to-succeed.html|title=Most Likely to Succeed|first=Alessandra|last=Stanley |authorlink=Alessandra Stanley |date=November 22, 1992|work=The New York Times}}</ref> British writer and feminist [[Sara Maitland]] said of Clinton, "I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things".<ref name="Hoffman"/> He also developed an interest in [[rugby union]], which he played at Oxford.<ref>{{cite book | title=Rugby Union for Dummies |first1=Nick | last1=Cain |first2=Greg | last2=Growden |author2link=Greg Growden |lastauthoramp=yes | chapter=21: Ten Peculiar Facts about Rugby | page=297 | edition=2 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | location= [[Chichester]], England | isbn=978-0-470-03537-5|year=2006 }}</ref>

While Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the [[University of Oxford]], specifically for being "a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace", having "a powerful collaborator in his wife," and for winning "general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget".<ref name="Dowd"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/doctor-without-a-thesis-bill-clinton-gets-an-oxford-degree-today-but-jonathan-eyals-verdict-on-his-1421189.html|title=Doctor without a thesis: Bill Clinton gets an Oxford degree today, but Jonathan Eyal's verdict on his term's work is: a disaster|first=Jonathan|last=Eyal|date=June 8, 1994|work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref>

===Vietnam War opposition and draft controversy===

During the Vietnam War, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.<ref>{{cite book|author=Neil A. Hamilton|title=Presidents: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfbt5NXvF64C&pg=PA366|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0816-2|page=366}}</ref> While at Oxford, he participated in [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|Vietnam War protests]] and organized a [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]] event in October 1969.<ref name="My Life" /> He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] or [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and he then made arrangements to join the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) program at the [[University of Arkansas]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven M. Gillon|title=The Pact: Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and the Rivalry that Defined a Generation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d-U2IzI2r5YC|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-532278-1|page=21}}</ref>

He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way "to maintain my political viability within the system".<ref>{{cite news | first=Bill | last=Clinton | agency=The Associated Press | title=The 1992 Campaign; A Letter By Clinton On His Draft Deferment: 'A War I Opposed And Despised' | work=The New York Times | date=February 13, 1992 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/13/us/1992-campaign-letter-clinton-his-draft-deferment-war-opposed-despised.html | access-date=July 30, 2019}}</ref> Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers{{nbsp}}1 to 310 would be [[Draft lottery (1969)|drafted]] before him, making it unlikely he would be called up.

[[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton's ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a [[notarize]]d statement during the 1992 presidential campaign:{{block indent|I was informed by the draft board that it was of interest to Senator Fulbright's office that Bill Clinton, a Rhodes Scholar, should be admitted to the [[ROTC]] program&nbsp;...

After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican [[John Paul Hammerschmidt]], Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the [[Watergate scandal]]. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52&nbsp;percent to 48&nbsp;percent margin.

Clinton was elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate [[Lynn Lowe]], a farmer from [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]].

Monroe Schwarzlose, of [[Kingsland, Arkansas|Kingsland]] in [[Cleveland County, Arkansas|Cleveland County]], polled 31&nbsp;percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980.

In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the [[Legal Services Corporation]]. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams.

Clinton was still the governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that [[Ricky Ray Rector]] would be executed.

Bush's [[United States presidential approval rating|approval ratings]] were around 80&nbsp;percent during the [[Gulf War]], and he was described as unbeatable.

Clinton was [[First inauguration of Bill Clinton|inaugurated]] as the 42nd president of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less than a month after taking office, he signed the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]], which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&session=1&vote=00011 | title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 103rd Congress—1st Session | publisher=United States Senate | accessdate= August 30, 2011}}</ref> and was popular with the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protectfamilyleave.org/pdf/030608_ncpfl_fmla_national_survey.pdf |title=New Nationwide Poll Shows Strong Support for Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) |publisher=Protect Family Leave |accessdate=August 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227065806/http://www.protectfamilyleave.org/pdf/030608_ncpfl_fmla_national_survey.pdf |archivedate=December 27, 2011 |df= }}</ref>

Two days after taking office, on January 22, 1993—the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''—Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international [[family planning]] programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sharon L.

On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a [[budget deficit]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/15/us/white-house-hones-all-out-campaign-to-sell-sacrifice.html | title=White House Hones All-Out Campaign to Sell Sacrifice | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 15, 1993 | author=Richard L.

On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office. This caused the [[White House travel office controversy]] even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be [[At-will employment|dismissed without cause]].

In August, Clinton signed the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]], which passed Congress without a Republican vote.

On September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding [[Clinton health care plan|a health care reform plan]]; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the [[American Medical Association]], and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer [[John F. Harris]] said the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House.<ref name="The Survivor" /> Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by [[George J. Mitchell]] failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.<ref name="The Natural" /><ref name="The Survivor" />

In November 1993, [[David Hale (Whitewater)|David Hale]]—the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy—alleged that while he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal.<ref name="salon031798">{{cite news|first1=Jonathan | last1=Broder |author2-link=Murray Waas |first2=Murray | last2=Waas | url=http://www.salon.com/news/1998/03/cov_17news.html | title=The Road To Hale | work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] | date=March 17, 1998 | accessdate=August 25, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616194202/http://salon.com/news/1998/03/cov_17news.html | archivedate=June 16, 2006 }}</ref> A [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.

On November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]], which mandated federal [[background check]]s on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|NICS system]] was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]], a subsidy for low-income workers.<ref name="The Survivor" />

In December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers [[Larry Patterson]] and Roger Perry were first reported by [[David Brock]] in ''[[The American Spectator]].'' In the affair later known as "[[Troopergate (Bill Clinton)|Troopergate]]", the officers alleged that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named ''Paula'', a reference to [[Paula Jones]]. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated "bad journalism", and that "the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives".<ref name="apology">{{Cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/10/brocks.remorse | title=Reporter Apologizes For Clinton Sex Article | publisher=CNN | date=March 10, 1998 | first=Jonathan | last=Karl | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614124146/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/10/brocks.remorse/| archivedate=June 14, 2008}}</ref>

That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]", which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Feder |first1=Jody | title="Don't Ask, Don't Tell": A Legal Analysis | publisher=DIANE Publishing | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4379-2208-0}}</ref> The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including senators [[John McCain]] (R-AZ) and [[Sam Nunn]] (D-GA).

Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and one independent against).

A speech delivered by President Bill Clinton at the December 6, 1995 [[White House Conference]] on HIV/AIDS projected that a cure for AIDS and a vaccine to prevent further infection would be developed. The President focused on his administration's accomplishments and efforts related to the [[epidemic]], including an accelerated drug-approval process. He also condemned [[homophobia]] and discrimination against people with [[HIV]]. Clinton announced three new initiatives: creating a special working group to coordinate AIDS research throughout the [[Federal government]]; convening public health experts to develop an action plan that integrates HIV prevention with substance abuse prevention; and launching a new effort by the [[Justice Department]] to ensure that health care facilities provide equal access to people with HIV and AIDS.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Activists at gathering plead with Clinton to take the lead |journal=AIDS Policy & Law |date=29 December 1995 |volume=10 |issue=22 |pages=1, 10 |pmid=11362952 }}</ref>

On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-104publ199 | publisher=United States Government Printing Office | title=PUBLIC LAW 104–199—DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT}}</ref> [[Paul Yandura]], speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clinton's signing DOMA "was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election".

Clinton received 379 of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes. He became the first Democratic incumbent since [[Lyndon B.

Senators [[Ted Kennedy]]—a Democrat—and [[Orrin Hatch]]—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the [[Foster Care Independence Act]].

While the [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during ''[[Clinton v. Jones|Jones v.

In April 1994, [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] broke out in [[Rwanda]].

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====

In 1995, U.S. and [[NATO]] aircraft [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|bombed Bosnian Serb targets]] to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the [[Bosnian war]]. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent [[Dayton Agreement]].<ref>Thomas H. Henriksen, ''Clinton's Foreign Policy in Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, and North Korea'' (Hoover Press, 1996).</ref>

====Irish peace talks====

In 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to [[Northern Ireland]], but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]]. In 1994 Clinton angered London by granting a visa to [[Gerry Adams]], leader of [[Sinn Féin]], the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]'s political arm. In November 1995, Clinton became the first U.S. president to visit [[Northern Ireland]], seeing both the divided communities of [[Belfast]] and later famously handshaking Adams, 14 months into an IRA ceasefire during [[the Troubles]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/30/newsid_4459000/4459860.stm|title=1995: Clinton kindles hope in Northern Ireland|date=November 30, 1995 |language=en-GB |access-date=December 12, 2019}}</ref> Despite [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London, Dublin, the paramilitaries and the other groups.

====Iran====

In February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8{{nbsp}}million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|131.8|1996|r=2}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the [[International Court of Justice]] after the shooting down of [[Iran Air Flight 655]] by the U.S. Navy [[guided missile cruiser]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/07/the-vincennes-downing-of-iran-air-flight-655-the-united-states-tried-to-cover-up-its-own-destruction-of-a-passenger-plane.html | title=America's Flight 17 | work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=July 23, 2014}}</ref>

====Kosovo====

[[File:President Clinton greets the crowd at Spangdahlem Air Base.jpg|thumb|left|Clinton greets Air Force personnel at [[Spangdahlem Air Base]], May 5, 1999.]]

In the midst of a brutal crackdown on [[Kosovo Liberation Army|ethnic Albanian separatists]] in the province of [[Kosovo]] by the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named [[Operation Allied Force]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Clines |first1=Francis X. |title=NATO Opens Broad Barrage Against Serbs as Clinton Denounces 'Brutal Repression' |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/world/europe/032599kosovo-rdp.html |work=The New York Times |date=March 25, 1999}}</ref> The stated reasoning behind the intervention was to stop the [[ethnic cleansing]] (and what the Clinton administration labeled [[genocide]])<ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen |first=William |date=April 7, 1999 |url=https://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=582 |title=Secretary Cohen's Press Conference at NATO Headquarters |accessdate=February 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Clinton |first=Bill |date=August 30, 2011 |url=http://clinton6.nara.gov/1999/06/1999-06-25-press-conference-by-the-president.html |title=Press Conference by the President |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006054609/http://clinton6.nara.gov/1999/06/1999-06-25-press-conference-by-the-president.html |archivedate=October 6, 2006 |df= }}</ref> of Albanians by Yugoslav anti-guerilla military units.

Several women have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time, because of the vast power differential between a 22-year old intern and the president of the United States. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]], with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair.<ref name="hallmark1">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/abuse-allegations-have-revived-scrutiny-of-bill-clinton--and-divided-democrats/2017/11/17/3d1711c8-cba4-11e7-b244-2d22ac912500_story.html|title=Abuse allegations have revived scrutiny of Bill Clinton—and divided Democrats|first1=Karen|last1=Tumulty|first2=Katie|last2=Mettler|date=November 17, 2017 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=November 19, 2017 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119050428/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/abuse-allegations-have-revived-scrutiny-of-bill-clinton--and-divided-democrats/2017/11/17/3d1711c8-cba4-11e7-b244-2d22ac912500_story.html|archivedate=November 19, 2017}}</ref><ref name="mccoy1">{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/reckoning-with-bill-clintons-sex-crimes/545729|title=Bill Clinton: A Reckoning|first=Caitlin|last=Flanagan|website=The Atlantic|access-date=November 19, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118231945/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/reckoning-with-bill-clintons-sex-crimes/545729/|archivedate=November 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/17/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-bill-clinton-democrats/index.html|title=Should Democrats turn their backs on Bill Clinton?|first=Z.
