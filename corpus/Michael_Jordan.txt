'''Michael Jeffrey Jordan''' (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials '''MJ''',<ref>Rein, Kotler and Shields, p. 173.</ref> is an American former professional [[basketball]] player who is the principal owner of the [[Charlotte Hornets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He played 15 seasons in the NBA, winning six championships with the [[Chicago Bulls]]. His biography on the official [[NBA]] website states: "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."<ref name="nbah" /> He was integral in helping to popularize the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,<ref name="Markovits">Markovits and Rensman, p. 89.</ref> becoming an American and global [[cultural icon]] in the process.<ref name="faze.ca">{{cite web|url=https://faze.ca/michael-jordan-a-global-icon/|title=Michael Jordan: A Global Icon|access-date=August 18, 2020}}</ref>

Jordan played [[college basketball]] for three seasons under coach [[Dean Smith]] with the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]]. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in [[1982 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1982]]. Jordan joined the Bulls in [[1984–85 NBA season|1984]] as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players.<ref name="defensive players" /> His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing [[slam dunk]]s from the [[free throw line]] in [[Slam Dunk Contest]]s, earned him the nicknames "'''Air Jordan'''" and "'''His Airness'''". Jordan won his first NBA championship with the Bulls in 1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a "[[three-peat]]". Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the [[1993–94 NBA season]] to play [[Minor League Baseball]], but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. He retired for a second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the [[Washington Wizards]].

Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards]], ten [[List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders|scoring titles]] (both all-time records), five [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Awards]], ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First Team designations, nine [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive]] First Team honors, fourteen [[NBA All-Star Game]] selections, three [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star Game MVP Awards]], three [[List of National Basketball Association annual steals leaders|steals titles]], and the 1988 [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]. He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and  career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by [[ESPN]], and was second to [[Babe Ruth]] on the [[Associated Press]]' list of athletes of the century. Jordan was twice inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]], once in 2009 for his individual career and again in 2010 as part of the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team]] ("The Dream Team"). He became a member of the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]] in 2015.

One of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation,<ref name="Markovits"/> Jordan is also known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s [[Air Jordan]] sneakers which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular today.<ref name="remain popular" /> Jordan also starred as himself in the 1996 film ''[[Space Jam]]''. He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats (now Hornets) in 2006, and bought a controlling interest in 2010. In 2014, Jordan became the first billionaire player in NBA history. With a net worth of $2.1&nbsp;billion, he is the fourth-richest African American, behind [[Robert F. Smith (investor)|Robert F. Smith]], [[David Steward]], and [[Oprah Winfrey]].

=== Early NBA years (1984–1987) ===
The [[1984–85 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]] selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the [[1984 NBA draft]], after [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] ([[1984–85 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]]) and [[Sam Bowie]] ([[1984–85 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]]).
