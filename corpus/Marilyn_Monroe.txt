'''Marilyn Monroe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|ɹ|ɪ|l|ɪ|n|_|m|ə|n|ˈ|ɹ|oʊ}}; born '''Norma Jeane Mortenson'''; June 1, 1926&nbsp;– August 4, 1962) was an American actress, model, and singer. Famous for playing comedic "[[blonde bombshell (stereotype)|blonde bombshell]]" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s and was emblematic of the era's changing attitudes towards sexuality. She was a top-billed actress for only a decade, but her films grossed $200&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|USD|0.2|1962}} billion in {{Inflation/year|USD}}) by the time of [[Death of Marilyn Monroe|her death]] in 1962.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-marilyn-monroe-19620806-story.html|title=Marilyn Monroe Dies; Pills Blamed|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=August 6, 1962|accessdate=September 23, 2015|first1=Howard|last1=Hertel|first2=Don|last2=Heff|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925094726/http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-marilyn-monroe-19620806-story.html|archive-date=September 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Long after her death, she has continued to be a major icon of [[popular culture|pop culture]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=2001|1pp=542–543|2a1=Hall|2y=2006|2p=468}}

Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married at age 16. She was working in a factory as part of the war effort during World War II when she met a photographer from the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] and began a successful pin-up modeling career, which led to short-lived film contracts with [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Columbia Pictures]]. After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in late 1950. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including ''[[As Young as You Feel]]'' and ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'', and in the dramas ''[[Clash by Night]]'' and ''[[Don't Bother to Knock]]''. She faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before she became a star, but the story did not damage her career and instead resulted in increased interest in her films.

By 1953, Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars; she had leading roles in the [[film noir]] ''[[Niagara (film)|Niagara]]'', which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' and ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'', which established her star image as a "dumb blonde". The same year, her nude images were used as the centerfold and on the cover of the first issue of ''[[Playboy]]''. She played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, but she was disappointed when she was typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project but returned to star in ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' (1955), one of the biggest box office successes of her career.

When the studio was still reluctant to change Monroe's contract, she founded her own film production company in 1954. She dedicated 1955 to building the company and began studying [[method acting]] under [[Lee Strasberg]] at the [[Actors Studio]]. Later that year, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. Her subsequent roles included a critically acclaimed performance in ''[[Bus Stop (1956 film)|Bus Stop]]'' (1956) and her first independent production in ''[[The Prince and the Showgirl]]'' (1957). She won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for her work in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), a critical and commercial success. Her last completed film was the drama ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961).

Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with addiction, depression, and anxiety. Her marriages to retired baseball star [[Joe DiMaggio]] and to playwright [[Arthur Miller]] were highly publicized, and both ended in divorce. On August 4, 1962, she died at age 36 from an overdose of [[barbiturate]]s at her home in Los Angeles. Her death was ruled a probable suicide, although several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death.

===1926–1943: Childhood and first marriage===
[[File:Marilyn monroe as an infant brightened.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=Monroe as an infant, wearing a white dress and sitting on a sheepskin rug|Monroe as an infant, {{circa|1927}}]]

Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the [[Los Angeles County Hospital]] in Los Angeles, California, on June 1, 1926.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=3, 13–14|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=13}} Her mother, Gladys Pearl Baker ([[née]] Monroe, 1902–1984), was from a poor [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] family who had migrated to California at the turn of the century.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=9–10|2a1=Rollyson|2y=2014|2pp=26–29}} At the age of 15, Gladys married John Newton Baker, an abusive man nine years her senior, and had two children by him named Robert (1917–1933){{sfnm|1a1=Miracle|1a2=Miracle|1y=1994|1p=see family tree|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=19–20|3a1=Leaming|3y=1998|3pp=52–53}} and Berniece (b. 1919).{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=7–9|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=19}} She successfully filed for divorce and sole custody in 1923, but Baker kidnapped the children soon after and moved with them to his native [[Kentucky]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=9 for the exact year when divorce was finalized|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=20|3a1=Leaming|3y=1998|3pp=52–53}} Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was 12, and met her sister for the first time as an adult.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=88, for first meeting in 1944|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=72, for mother telling Monroe of sister in 1938}} Following the divorce, Gladys worked as a film negative cutter at [[Consolidated Film Industries]].{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=150, citing Spoto and Summers|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp= 24–25}} In 1924, Gladys married Martin Edward Mortensen, but they separated only some months later and divorced in 1928.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=150, citing Spoto and Summers|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp= 24–25}} The identity of Monroe's father is unknown, and she most often used Baker as her surname.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=17, 57}}{{efn|Gladys named Mortensen as Monroe's father in the birth certificate (although the name was misspelled),{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=150, citing Spoto, Summers and Guiles}} but it is unlikely that he was the father as their separation had taken place well before she became pregnant.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1pp=149–152|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=26|3a1=Spoto|3y=2001|3p=13}} Biographers Fred Guiles and [[Lois Banner]] have stated that her father was most likely Charles Stanley Gifford, a co-worker with whom Gladys had an affair in 1925, whereas [[Donald Spoto]] thinks another co-worker was most likely the father.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=152|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=26|3a1=Spoto|3y=2001|3p=13}}}}

Although Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, Monroe's early childhood was stable and happy.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=17–26|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=32–35}} Gladys placed her daughter with [[evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]]; she also lived there for the first six months, until she was forced to move back to the city due to work.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=16–26|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=164|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=22–35}} She then began visiting her daughter on weekends.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=17–26|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=32–35}} In the summer of 1933, Gladys bought a small house in [[Hollywood]] with a loan from the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] and moved seven-year-old Monroe in with her.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=26–28|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=35–39|3a1=Leaming|3y=1998|3pp=54–55}} They shared the house with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=26–28|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=35–39}} In January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]].{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=155–156}} After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the [[Metropolitan State Hospital (California)|Metropolitan State Hospital]].{{sfnm|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=39–40|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1pp=155–156}} She spent the rest of her life in and out of hospitals and was rarely in contact with Monroe.{{sfnm|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=39–42, 45–47, 62, 72, 91, 205|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=100–101, 106–107, 215–216}} Monroe became a [[ward (law)|ward of the state]], and her mother's friend, Grace Goddard, took responsibility over her and her mother's affairs.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=40–49|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=165|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=40–62}}

In the next four years, Monroe's living situation changed often. For the first 16 months, she continued living with the Atkinsons, and was [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] during this time.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=33–40|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=40–54}}{{efn|Monroe spoke about being sexually abused by a lodger when she was eight years old to her biographers [[Ben Hecht]] in 1953–1954 and [[Maurice Zolotow]] in 1960, and in interviews for ''[[Paris Match]]'' and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=48–49}} Although she refused to name the abuser, Banner believes he was George Atkinson, as he was a lodger and fostered Monroe when she was eight; Banner also states that Monroe's description of the abuser fits other descriptions of Atkinson.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=40–59}} Banner has argued that the abuse may have been a major causative factor in Monroe's mental health problems, and has also written that as the subject was taboo in mid-century United States, Monroe was unusual in daring to speak about it publicly.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=7, 40–59}} Spoto does not mention the incident but states that Monroe was sexually abused by Grace's husband in 1937 and by a cousin while living with a relative in 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=55|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=166–173}} Barbara Leaming repeats Monroe's account of the abuse, but earlier biographers Fred Guiles, Anthony Summers and Carl Rollyson have doubted the incident due to lack of evidence beyond Monroe's statements.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=166–173}}}} Always a shy girl, she now also developed a [[stutter]] and became withdrawn.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp= 27, 54–73}} In the summer of 1935, she briefly stayed with Grace and her husband Erwin "Doc" Goddard and two other families,{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=47–48}} and in September, Grace placed her in the Los Angeles Orphans Home.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=44–45|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=165–166|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=62–63}} The orphanage was "a model institution" and was described in positive terms by her peers, but Monroe felt abandoned.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=60–63}} Encouraged by the orphanage staff who thought that Monroe would be happier living in a family, Grace became her [[legal guardian]] in 1936, but did not take her out of the orphanage until the summer of 1937.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=49–50|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=62–63 (see also footnotes), 455}} Monroe's second stay with the Goddards lasted only a few months because Doc molested her;{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=62–64}} she then lived brief periods with her relatives and Grace's friends and relatives in Los Angeles and [[Compton, California|Compton]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=49–50|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=62–64, 455}}

Monroe found a more permanent home in September 1938, when she began living with Grace's aunt, Ana Lower, in [[Sawtelle, Los Angeles|Sawtelle]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=51–67|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=62–86}} She was enrolled in [[Emerson Junior High School]] and went to weekly [[Christian Science]] services with Lower.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=68–69|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=75–77}} Monroe was otherwise a mediocre student, but excelled in writing and contributed to the school newspaper.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=73–76}} Due to the elderly Lower's health problems, Monroe returned to live with the Goddards in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles|Van Nuys]] in around early 1941.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=67–69|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=86}} The same year, she began attending [[Van Nuys High School]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=67–69}} In 1942, the company that employed Doc Goddard relocated him to [[West Virginia]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=70–75|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=86–90}} California child protection laws prevented the Goddards from taking Monroe out of state, and she faced having to return to the orphanage.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=86–90}} As a solution, she married their neighbors' 21-year-old son, factory worker James Dougherty, on June 19, 1942, just after her 16th birthday.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=70–75}} Monroe subsequently dropped out of high school and became a housewife.

In April 1944, Dougherty was shipped out to the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific]], and he would remain there for most of the next two years.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=83–86|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=91–98}} Monroe moved in with his parents and began a job at the [[Radioplane Company]], a munitions factory in Van Nuys.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=83–86|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=91–98}} In late 1944, she met photographer [[David Conover]], who had been sent by the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]]' [[First Motion Picture Unit]] to the factory to shoot morale-boosting pictures of female workers.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=90–91|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=176}} Although none of her pictures were used, she quit working at the factory in January 1945 and began modeling for Conover and his friends.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=90–93|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=176–177}}<ref>{{cite web|title=YANK USA 1945|url=http://www.wartimepress.com/archives.asp?TID=YANK%20USA%201943&MID=YANK%20-%20USA%20Edition&q=357&FID=42|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807072009/http://www.wartimepress.com/archives.asp?TID=YANK%20USA%201943&MID=YANK%20-%20USA%20Edition&q=357&FID=42|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 7, 2017|publisher=Wartime Press|accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref> Defying her deployed husband, she moved on her own and signed a contract with the Blue Book Model Agency in August 1945.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=103–104}}

While at Fox, Monroe was given "girl next door" roles; at Columbia, she was modeled after [[Rita Hayworth]].{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=139}} Her hairline was raised and her hair was bleached platinum blonde.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=133–134}} She also began working with the studio's head drama coach, [[Natasha Lytess]], who would remain her mentor until 1955.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=133–134}} Her only film at the studio was the low-budget musical ''[[Ladies of the Chorus]]'' (1948), in which she had her first starring role as a chorus girl who is courted by a wealthy man.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=59}} She also screen-tested for the lead role in ''[[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|Born Yesterday]]'' (1950), but her contract was not renewed in September 1948.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=148}} ''Ladies of the Chorus'' was released the following month but was not a success.{{sfn|Summers|1985|p=43}}

Monroe then became the protégée of [[Johnny Hyde]], the vice president of the [[William Morris Agency]]. Their relationship soon became sexual and he proposed marriage, but Monroe refused.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=145–146|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=149, 157}} He paid for Monroe to have plastic surgery on her jaw and possibly a [[rhinoplasty]], and arranged a bit part in the [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Love Happy]]'' (1950), the New York promotional tour of which she also joined in 1949.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=146|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=148–149}} Meanwhile, Monroe continued modeling. She appeared in advertisements for [[Pabst Brewing Company|Pabst]] beer and posed in artistic nudes for John Baumgarth calendars (using the name 'Mona Monroe'); both sessions were shot by [[Tom Kelley (photographer)|Tom Kelley]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=151–153}} Monroe had previously posed semi-nude or clad in a bikini for other artists such as [[Earl Moran]], and felt comfortable with nudity.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=151–153|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=140–149}} Baumgarth was initially not happy with the photos, but published one of them in 1950; Monroe was not publicly identified as the model until 1952. Although she then contained the resulting scandal by claiming she had reluctancly posed nude due to an urgent need for cash, biographers Spoto and Banner have stated that she was not pressured (although according to Banner, she was initially hesitant due to her aspirations of movie stardom) and regarded the shoot as simply another work assignment.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=151–153|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=140–149}}

===1950–1952: Breakthrough years===

In 1950, Monroe had bit parts in ''Love Happy'', ''[[A Ticket to Tomahawk]]'', ''[[Right Cross]]'' and ''[[The Fireball]]'', but also appeared in minor supporting roles in two critically acclaimed films: [[Joseph Mankiewicz]]'s drama ''[[All About Eve]]'' and [[John Huston]]'s [[crime film]] ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]''.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=59–60}} Despite her screen time being only a few minutes in the latter, she gained a mention in ''[[Photoplay]]'' and according to biographer Donald Spoto "moved effectively from movie model to serious actress".{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=159–162}} In December 1950, Hyde was able to negotiate a seven-year contract for Monroe with 20th Century-Fox.{{sfnm|1a1=Riese|1a2=Hitchens|1y=1988|1p=228|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2p=182}} He died of a heart attack only days later, which left her devastated.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=175–177|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=157}}

The Fox contract brought Monroe more publicity, and she had supporting roles in four low-budget films in 1951: in the [[MGM]] drama ''[[Home Town Story]]'', and in three moderately successful comedies for Fox, ''[[As Young as You Feel]]'', ''[[Love Nest]]'', and ''[[Let's Make It Legal]]''.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=60}} According to Spoto all four films featured her "essentially [as] a sexy ornament", but she received some praise from critics: [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described her as "superb" in ''As Young As You Feel'' and Ezra Goodman of the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News (historic)|Los Angeles Daily News]]'' called her "one of the brightest up-and-coming [actresses]" for ''Love Nest''.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=179–187|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=60}} Her popularity with audiences was also growing: she received several thousand fan letters a week, and was declared "Miss [[pin-up|Cheesecake]] of 1951" by the army newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'', reflecting the preferences of soldiers in the [[Korean War]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=192}} In February 1952, the [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] named Monroe the "best young box office personality".<ref name=gg>{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/articles/marilyn-globes-golden-girl|title=Marilyn: The Globes' Golden Girl|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] (HFPA)|accessdate=September 11, 2015|first=Yoram|last=Kahana|date=January 30, 2014}}</ref> In her private life, Monroe had a short relationship with director [[Elia Kazan]] and also briefly dated several other men, including director [[Nicholas Ray]] and actors [[Yul Brynner]] and [[Peter Lawford]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=180–181|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=163–167, 181–182 for Kazan and others}} In early 1952, she began a highly publicized romance with retired [[New York Yankees]] baseball star [[Joe DiMaggio]], one of the most famous sports personalities of the era.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=201|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=192}}

Monroe found herself at the center of a scandal in March 1952, when she revealed that she had posed for nude pictures in 1949, which were now featured in a calendar.{{sfnm|1a1=Summers|1y=1985|1p=58|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2pp=210–213}} The studio had learned about the photos and that she was publicly rumored to be the model some weeks prior, and together with Monroe decided that to avoid damaging her career it was best to admit to them while stressing that she had been broke at the time.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=210–213|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=224–226|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=194–195}} The strategy gained her public sympathy and increased interest in her films, for which she was now receiving [[billing (filmmaking)|top-billing]]. In the wake of the scandal, Monroe was featured on the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' as the "Talk of Hollywood" and gossip columnist [[Hedda Hopper]] declared her the "cheesecake queen" turned "box office smash".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1952/05/04/page/103/article/they-call-her-the-blowtorch-blonde|title=They Call Her The Blowtorch Blonde|work=Chicago Tribune|date=May 4, 1952|accessdate=October 18, 2015|first=Hedda|last=Hopper|authorlink=Hedda Hopper}}</ref> Fox released three of Monroe's films —''[[Clash by Night]]'', ''[[Don't Bother to Knock]]'' and ''[[We're Not Married!]]''—  soon after to capitalize on the public interest.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=210–213|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=61–62, 224–226|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=194–195}}

Despite her newfound popularity as a sex symbol, Monroe also wished to show more of her acting range. She had begun taking acting classes with [[Michael Chekhov]] and mime Lotte Goslar soon after beginning the Fox contract,{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=188–189|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=170–171, 178 for not wanting to be solely a sex symbol}} and ''Clash by Night'' and ''Don't Bother to Knock'' showed her in more nuanced roles.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=61 for being commercially successful|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=178 for wishes to not be solely a sex symbol}} In the former, a drama starring [[Barbara Stanwyck]] and directed by [[Fritz Lang]], she played a fish cannery worker; to prepare, she spent time in a fish cannery in [[Monterey]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=194–195|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=60–61}} She received positive reviews for her performance: ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that "she deserves starring status with her excellent interpretation", and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that she "has an ease of delivery which makes her a cinch for popularity".{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=194–195}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/50452|title=Clash By Night|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref> The latter was a thriller in which Monroe starred as a mentally disturbed babysitter and which Zanuck used to test her abilities in a heavier dramatic role.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=196–197}} It received mixed reviews from critics, with Crowther deeming her too inexperienced for the difficult role,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9400E7DA153AE23BBC4152DFB1668389649EDE|title=Don't Bother to Knock|date=July 19, 1952|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 8, 2015|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|authorlink=Bosley Crowther}}</ref> and ''Variety'' blaming the script for the film's problems.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=61|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=180}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1951/film/reviews/don-t-bother-to-knock-1200417267/|title=Review: Don't Bother to Knock|date=December 31, 1951|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref>

Monroe's three other films in 1952 continued with her typecasting in comic roles that focused on her sex appeal. In ''We're Not Married!'', her role as a beauty pageant contestant was created solely to "present Marilyn in two bathing suits", according to its writer [[Nunnally Johnson]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=200}} In [[Howard Hawks]]' ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'', in which she acted opposite [[Cary Grant]], she played a secretary who is a "dumb, childish blonde, innocently unaware of the havoc her sexiness causes around her".{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=62}} In ''[[O. Henry's Full House]]'', she had a minor role as a sex worker.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=62}} Monroe added to her reputation as a new sex symbol with publicity stunts that year: she wore a revealing dress when acting as Grand Marshal at the [[Miss America Pageant]] parade, and told gossip columnist [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] that she usually wore no underwear.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=224–225}} By the end of the year, gossip columnist [[Florabel Muir]] named Monroe the "[[it girl]]" of 1952.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1952/10/19/page/103/article/marilyn-monroe-tells|title=Marilyn Monroe Tells: How to Deal With Wolves|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=October 19, 1952|accessdate=October 18, 2015|first=Florabel|last=Muir}}</ref>

During this period, Monroe gained a reputation for being difficult to work with, which would worsen as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=238}} Her dependence on her acting coaches—Natasha Lytess and then [[Paula Strasberg]]—also irritated directors.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=139, 195, 233–234, 241, 244, 372}} Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=328–329|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp= 188–189, 211–214|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=51–56, 238}} She disliked her lack of control on film sets and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=328–329|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp= 188–189, 211–214|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=51–56, 238}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/marilyn-monroe-filmmaker-interview-gail-levin/63/|title=Filmmaker Interview – Gail Levin|publisher=[[PBS]]|date=July 19, 2006|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref> To alleviate her anxiety and chronic [[insomnia]], she began to use [[barbiturate]]s, [[amphetamines]], and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=328–329|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=211–214, 311|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=238}} According to [[Sarah Churchwell]], some of Monroe's behavior, especially later in her career, was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp= 257–264}} Similarly, biographer [[Lois Banner]] has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp= 189–190, 210–211}}

Monroe starred in three movies that were released in 1953 and emerged as a major sex symbol and one of Hollywood's most bankable performers.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=221|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=61–65|3a1=Lev|3y=2013|3p=168}}<ref name="www.quigleypublishing.com Top10_lists">{{cite web |url=http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |title=The 2006 Motion Picture Almanac, Top Ten Money Making Stars |publisher=Quigley Publishing Company |accessdate=August 25, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221063625/http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |archivedate=December 21, 2014}}</ref> The first was the [[Technicolor]] [[film noir]] ''[[Niagara (1953 film)|Niagara]]'', in which she played a ''[[femme fatale]]'' scheming to murder her husband, played by [[Joseph Cotten]].{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=233}} By then, Monroe and her make-up artist [[Allan "Whitey" Snyder]] had developed her "trademark" make-up look: dark arched brows, pale skin, "glistening" red lips and a [[beauty mark]].{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=25, 62}} According to Sarah Churchwell, ''Niagara'' was one of the most overtly sexual films of Monroe's career.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=62}} In some scenes, Monroe's body was covered only by a sheet or a towel, considered shocking by contemporary audiences.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=195–196}} ''Niagara'''s most famous scene is a 30-second [[long shot]] behind Monroe where she is seen walking with her hips swaying, which was used heavily in the film's marketing.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=195–196}}

When ''Niagara'' was released in January 1953, [[women's club (United States)|women's clubs]] protested it as immoral, but it proved popular with audiences.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=221|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=205|3a1=Leaming|3y=1998|3p=75 on box office figure}} While ''Variety'' deemed it "clichéd" and "morbid", ''The New York Times'' commented that "the falls and Miss Monroe are something to see", as although Monroe may not be "the perfect actress at this point ... she can be seductive—even when she walks".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE0DF163FE53ABC4A51DFB7668388649EDE|title=Niagara Falls Vies With Marilyn Monroe|work=The New York Times|date=January 22, 1953|accessdate=October 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105231428/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE0DF163FE53ABC4A51DFB7668388649EDE|archive-date=November 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1952/film/reviews/niagara-1200417447/|title=Review: 'Niagara'|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=December 31, 1952|accessdate=October 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121060822/http://variety.com/1952/film/reviews/niagara-1200417447/|archive-date=November 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
Monroe continued to attract attention by wearing revealing outfits, most famously at the ''Photoplay'' awards in January 1953, where she won the "Fastest Rising Star" award.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=236–238|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=234|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=205–206}} She wore a skin-tight gold [[Lamé (fabric)|lamé]] dress, which prompted veteran star [[Joan Crawford]] to publicly call her behavior "unbecoming an actress and a lady".{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=236–238|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=234|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=205–206}}

While ''Niagara'' made Monroe a sex symbol and established her "look", her second film of 1953, the satirical musical comedy ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'', cemented her screen persona as a "dumb blonde".{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=231|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=64|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3p=200|4a1=Leaming|4y=1998|4pp=75–76}} Based on [[Anita Loos]]' [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (novel)|novel]] and [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (musical)|its Broadway version]], the film focuses on two "gold-digging" [[showgirl]]s played by Monroe and [[Jane Russell]]. Monroe's role was originally intended for [[Betty Grable]], who had been 20th Century-Fox's most popular "[[blonde bombshell (stereotype)|blonde bombshell]]" in the 1940s; Monroe was fast eclipsing her as a star who could appeal to both male and female audiences.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=219–220|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=177}} As part of the film's publicity campaign, she and Russell pressed their hand and footprints in wet concrete outside [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in June.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=242|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=208–209}} ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'' was released shortly after and became one of the biggest box office successes of the year.{{sfnm|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=63|1a1=Solomon|1y=1988|1p=89}} Crowther of ''The New York Times'' and William Brogdon of ''Variety'' both commented favorably on Monroe, especially noting her performance of "[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]"; according to the latter, she demonstrated the "ability to sex a song as well as point up the eye values of a scene by her presence".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1953/film/reviews/gentlemen-prefer-blondes-2-1200417560/|title=Gentlemen Prefer Blondes|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=July 1, 1953|accessdate=October 18, 2015|first=William|last=Brogdon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121062432/http://variety.com/1953/film/reviews/gentlemen-prefer-blondes-2-1200417560/|archive-date=November 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B07E0DC173DE23BBC4E52DFB1668388649EDE|title=Gentlemen Prefer Blondes|work=The New York Times|date=July 16, 1953|accessdate=October 18, 2015|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926154609/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B07E0DC173DE23BBC4E52DFB1668388649EDE|archive-date=September 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September, Monroe made her television debut in the ''[[Jack Benny Show]]'', playing Jack's fantasy woman in the episode "Honolulu Trip".{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=250}} She co-starred with Betty Grable and [[Lauren Bacall]] in her third movie of the year, ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'', released in November. It featured Monroe as a naïve model who teams up with her friends to find rich husbands, repeating the successful formula of ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes''. It was the second film ever released in [[CinemaScope]], a widescreen format that Fox hoped would draw audiences back to theaters as television was beginning to cause losses to film studios.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=238|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=64–65}} Despite mixed reviews, the film was Monroe's biggest box office success at that point in her career.{{sfnm|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=65|3a1=Lev|3y=2013|3p=209|1a1=Solomon|1y=1988|1p=89}}

Monroe was listed in the annual [[Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll]] in both 1953 and 1954,<ref name="www.quigleypublishing.com Top10_lists" /> and according to Fox historian Aubrey Solomon became the studio's "greatest asset" alongside CinemaScope.{{sfn|Solomon|1988|p=89}} Monroe's position as a leading sex symbol was confirmed in December 1953, when [[Hugh Hefner]] featured her on the cover and as centerfold in the first issue of ''[[Playboy]]''; Monroe did not consent to the publication.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=217}} The cover image was a photograph taken of her at the Miss America Pageant parade in 1952, and the centerfold featured one of her 1949 nude photographs.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=217}}

Monroe had become one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, but her contract had not changed since 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=68}} Her attempts to appear in films that would not focus on her as a pin-up had been thwarted by the studio head executive, Darryll F. Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in other types of roles.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=68, 208–209}} Under pressure from the studio's owner, [[Spyros Skouras]], Zanuck had also decided that Fox should focus exclusively on entertainment to maximize profits and canceled the production of any 'serious films'.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=217}} In January 1954, he suspended Monroe when she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, ''[[The Girl in Pink Tights]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Summers|1y=1985|1p=92|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2p=254–259}}

This was front-page news, and Monroe immediately took action to counter negative publicity. On January 14, she and Joe DiMaggio were married at the [[San Francisco City Hall]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=260}} They then traveled to Japan, combining a honeymoon with his business trip.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=262–263}} From Tokyo, she traveled alone to Korea, where she participated in a [[United Service Organizations|USO]] show, singing songs from her films for over 60,000 U.S. Marines over a four-day period.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=241}} After returning to the U.S., she was awarded ''Photoplay''{{'}}s "Most Popular Female Star" prize.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=267}} Monroe settled with Fox in March, with the promise of a new contract, a bonus of $100,000, and a starring role in the film adaptation of the Broadway success ''[[The Seven Year Itch (play)|The Seven Year Itch]]''.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=271}}

In April 1954, [[Otto Preminger]]'s [[western (genre)|western]] ''[[River of No Return]]'', the last film that Monroe had filmed prior to the suspension, was released. She called it a "[[Z movie|Z-grade]] cowboy movie in which the acting finished second to the scenery and the CinemaScope process", but it was popular with audiences.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=66–67}} The first film she made after the suspension was the musical ''[[There's No Business Like Show Business (film)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]'', which she strongly disliked but the studio required her to do for dropping ''The Girl in Pink Tights''.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=271}} It was unsuccessful upon its release in late 1954, with Monroe's performance considered vulgar by many critics.{{sfnm|1a1=Riese|1a2=Hitchens|1y=1988|1pp=338–440|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2p=277|3a1=Churchwell|3y=2004|3p=66|4a1=Banner|4y=2012|4p=227}}

In September 1954, Monroe began filming [[Billy Wilder]]'s comedy ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'', starring opposite [[Tom Ewell]] as a woman who becomes the object of her married neighbor's sexual fantasies. Although the film was shot in Hollywood, the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene in which Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of [[white dress of Marilyn Monroe|her white dress]] on [[Lexington Avenue]] in Manhattan.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=283–284}} The shoot lasted for several hours and attracted nearly 2,000 spectators.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=283–284}} The "subway grate scene" became one of Monroe's most famous and ''The Seven Year Itch'' became one of the biggest commercial successes of the year after its release in June 1955.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=331}}

The publicity stunt placed Monroe on international front pages, and it also marked the end of her marriage to DiMaggio, who was infuriated by it.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=284–285|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=8–9}} The union had been troubled from the start by his jealousy and controlling attitude; he was also physically abusive.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=208, 222–223, 262–267, 292|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=243–245|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=204, 219–221}} After returning from NYC to Hollywood in October 1954, Monroe filed for divorce, after only nine months of marriage.{{sfnm|1a1=Summers|1y=1985|1pp=103–105|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2pp=290–295|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=224–225}}

After filming for ''The Seven Year Itch'' wrapped up in November 1954, Monroe left Hollywood for the East Coast, where she and photographer [[Milton Greene]] founded their own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP)—an action that has later been called "instrumental" in the collapse of the [[studio system]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=295–298|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=246}}{{efn|Monroe and Greene had first met and had a brief affair in 1949, and met again in 1953, when he photographed her for ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]''. She told him about her grievances with the studio, and Greene suggested that they start their own production company.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=158–159, 252–254}}}} Monroe stated that she was "tired of the same old sex roles" and asserted that she was no longer under contract to Fox, as it had not fulfilled its duties, such as paying her the promised bonus.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=302–303}} This began a year-long legal battle between her and Fox in January 1955.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=301–302}} The press largely ridiculed Monroe and she was parodied in the Broadway play ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (play)|Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]'' (1955), in which her lookalike [[Jayne Mansfield]] played a dumb actress who starts her own production company.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=338}}

[[File:Monroe Actors Studio.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Monroe, who is wearing a skirt, blouse and jacket, standing below a sign for the Actors Studio looking up towards it|Monroe at the [[Actors Studio]]]]
After founding MMP, Monroe moved to Manhattan and spent 1955 studying acting. She took classes with [[Constance Collier]] and attended workshops on [[method acting]] at the [[Actors Studio]], run by [[Lee Strasberg]].{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=302}} She grew close to Strasberg and his wife Paula, receiving private lessons at their home due to her shyness, and soon became a family member.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=327}} She replaced her old acting coach, Natasha Lytess, with Paula; the Strasbergs remained an important influence for the rest of her career.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=350}} Monroe also started undergoing [[psychoanalysis]], as Strasberg believed that an actor must confront their emotional traumas and use them in their performances.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=310–313}}{{efn|Monroe underwent psychoanalysis regularly from 1955 until her death. Her analysts were psychiatrists Margaret Hohenberg (1955–57), [[Anna Freud]] (1957), [[Ernst Kris|Marianne Kris]] (1957–61), and [[Ralph Greenson]] (1960–62).{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=312–313, 375, 384–385, 421, 459 on years and names}}}}

Monroe continued her relationship with DiMaggio despite the ongoing divorce process; she also dated actor [[Marlon Brando]] and playwright [[Arthur Miller]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|pp=319–332|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=253, for Miller|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3p=285, for Brando}} She had first been introduced to Miller by [[Elia Kazan]] in the early 1950s.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|pp=319–332|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=253, for Miller|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3p=285, for Brando}} The affair between Monroe and Miller became increasingly serious after October 1955, when her divorce was finalized and he separated from his wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=337|2a1=Meyers|2y=2010|2p=98}} The studio urged her to end it, as Miller was being investigated by the [[FBI]] for allegations of [[communism]] and had been subpoenaed by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], but Monroe refused.{{sfnm|1a1=Summers|1y=1985|1p=157|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2pp=318–320|3a1=Churchwell|3y=2004|3pp=253–254}} The relationship led to FBI opening a file on her.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=337|2a1=Meyers|2y=2010|2p=98}}

By the end of the year, Monroe and Fox signed a new seven-year contract, as MMP would not be able to finance films alone, and the studio was eager to have Monroe working for them again.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=301–302}} Fox would pay her $400,000 to make four films, and granted her the right to choose her own projects, directors and cinematographers.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=339–340}} She would also be free to make one film with MMP per each completed film for Fox.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=339–340}}

In March, Monroe began filming the drama ''[[Bus Stop (1956 film)|Bus Stop]]'', her first film under the new contract.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=345}} She played Chérie, a saloon singer whose dreams of stardom are complicated by a naïve cowboy who falls in love with her.

Monroe also experienced other problems during the production.

After ''Some Like It Hot'', Monroe took another hiatus until late 1959, when she starred in the musical comedy ''[[Let's Make Love]]''.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=71}} She chose [[George Cukor]] to direct and Miller re-wrote some of the script, which she considered weak; she accepted the part solely because she was behind on her contract with Fox.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=410–415}} The film's production was delayed by her frequent absences from the set.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=71}} During the shoot, Monroe had an extramarital affair with her co-star [[Yves Montand]], which was widely reported by the press and used in the film's publicity campaign.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=72}} ''Let's Make Love'' was unsuccessful upon its release in September 1960;{{sfnm|1a1=Riese|1a2=Hitchens|1y=1988|1p=270|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=266|3a1=Solomon|3y=1988|3p=139}} Crowther described Monroe as appearing "rather untidy" and "lacking ... the old Monroe dynamism",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A01E1DA1F3EEF3ABC4153DFBF66838B679EDE|title=Movie Review: Let's Make Love (1960)|work=The New York Times|date=September 9, 1960|accessdate=October 18, 2015|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011184254/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A01E1DA1F3EEF3ABC4153DFBF66838B679EDE|archive-date=October 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> and Hedda Hopper called the film "the most vulgar picture [Monroe's] ever done".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1960/08/25/page/138/article/hedda-finds-marilyns-new-film-most-vulgar|title=Hedda Finds Marilyn's Film 'Most Vulgar'|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=August 25, 1960|accessdate=October 18, 2015|first=Hedda|last=Hopper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422020025/http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1960/08/25/page/138/article/hedda-finds-marilyns-new-film-most-vulgar/|archive-date=April 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Truman Capote]] lobbied for Monroe to play Holly Golightly in [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|a film adaptation]] of ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', but the role went to [[Audrey Hepburn]] as its producers feared that she would complicate the production.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=335}}

The last film that Monroe completed was John Huston's ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'', which Miller had written to provide her with a dramatic role.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=266}} She played a recently divorced woman who becomes friends with three aging cowboys, played by [[Clark Gable]], [[Eli Wallach]] and [[Montgomery Clift]].

It was the real thing. She would go deep down within herself and find it and bring it up into consciousness."{{sfn|Tracy|2010|p=109}}

Monroe was next to star in a television adaptation of [[W.

She was absent for most of the production due to illness and was fired by Fox in June 1962, two months before her death]]
Monroe returned to the public eye in the spring of 1962; she received a "World Film Favorite" Golden Globe Award and began to shoot a film for Fox, ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'', a remake of ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940).{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=495–496|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=74–75}} It was to be co-produced by MMP, directed by George Cukor and to co-star [[Dean Martin]] and [[Cyd Charisse]].{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=258, for the involvement of MMP}} Days before filming began, Monroe caught [[sinusitis]]; despite medical advice to postpone the production, Fox began it as planned in late April.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=524–525|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=391–392|3a1=Rollyson|3y=2014|3pp=264–272}} Monroe was too sick to work for the majority of the next six weeks, but despite confirmations by multiple doctors, the studio pressurized her by alleging publicly that she was faking it.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=524–525|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=391–392|3a1=Rollyson|3y=2014|3pp=264–272}} On May 19, she took a break to sing "[[Happy Birthday, Mr. President]]" on stage at President [[John F.

Monroe next filmed a scene for ''Something's Got to Give'' in which she swam naked in a swimming pool.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=523}} To generate advance publicity, the press was invited to take photographs; these were later published in ''Life''. This was the first time that a major star had posed nude at the height of their career.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=74}} When she was again on sick leave for several days, Fox decided that it could not afford to have another film running behind schedule when it was already struggling with the rising costs of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963).{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=535}} On June 7, Fox fired Monroe and sued her for $750,000 in damages.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=75}} She was replaced by [[Lee Remick]], but after Martin refused to make the film with anyone other than Monroe, Fox sued him as well and shut down the production.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=535–536}} The studio blamed Monroe for the film's demise and began spreading negative publicity about her, even alleging that she was mentally disturbed.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=75}}

Fox soon regretted its decision and re-opened negotiations with Monroe later in June; a settlement about a new contract, including re-commencing ''Something's Got to Give'' and a starring role in the [[black comedy]] ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' (1964), was reached later that summer.{{sfnm|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3p=402|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2pp=537, 545–549|1a1=Rollyson|1y=2014|1p=273–274, 279}} She was also planning on starring in a biopic of [[Jean Harlow]].{{sfnm|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=401–402|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2pp=, 537, 545–549|1a1=Summers|1y=1985|1p=301}} To repair her public image, Monroe engaged in several publicity ventures, including interviews for ''Life'' and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and her first photo shoot for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.{{sfnm|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=285|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=538–543}} For ''Vogue'', she and photographer [[Bert Stern]] collaborated for two series of photographs, one a standard fashion editorial and another of her posing nude, which were published posthumously with the title ''[[The Last Sitting]]''.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=401}}

The 1940s had been the heyday for actresses who were perceived as tough and smart—such as [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]]—who had appealed to women-dominated audiences during the war years. 20th Century-Fox wanted Monroe to be a star of the new decade who would draw men to movie theaters, and saw her as a replacement for the aging [[Betty Grable]], their most popular "blonde bombshell" of the 1940s.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=124, 177}} According to film scholar [[Richard Dyer]], Monroe's star image was crafted mostly for the [[male gaze]].{{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=19, 20}}

From the beginning, Monroe played a significant part in the creation of her public image, and towards the end of her career exerted almost full control over it.{{sfnm|1a1=Banner|1y=2012|1pp=172–174|2a1=Hall|2y=2006|2p=489}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/model-arrangement-36654928/|title=Model Arrangement|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|date=May 2008|accessdate=September 11, 2015|first=Michelle|last=Stacey|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925201206/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/model-arrangement-36654928/|archive-date=September 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> She devised many of her publicity strategies, cultivated friendships with gossip columnists such as [[Sidney Skolsky]] and [[Louella Parsons]], and controlled the use of her images.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=172–174, 210–215, 566|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=172–174|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=9}} In addition to Grable, she was often compared to another iconic blonde, 1930s film star [[Jean Harlow]].{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=238}} The comparison was prompted partly by Monroe, who named Harlow as her childhood idol, wanted to play her in a biopic, and even employed Harlow's hair stylist to color her hair.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=38, 175, 343}}

Monroe's screen persona focused on her blonde hair and the stereotypes that were associated with it, especially dumbness, naïveté, sexual availability and artificiality.{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=21–26, 181–185}} She often used a breathy, childish voice in her films, and in interviews gave the impression that everything she said was "utterly innocent and uncalculated", parodying herself with [[double entendre]]s that came to be known as "Monroeisms".{{sfnm|1a1=Dyer|1y=1986|1pp=33–34|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2pp=25, 57–58|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3p=185|4a1=Hall|4y=2006|4p=489}} For example, when she was asked what she had on in the 1949 nude photo shoot, she replied, "I had the radio on".{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=194}}

Biographer [[Lois Banner]] has written that Monroe often subtly parodied her status as a sex symbol in her films and public appearances,{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=244}} and that "the 'Marilyn Monroe' character she created was a brilliant archetype, who stands between [[Mae West]] and [[Madonna]] in the tradition of twentieth-century gender tricksters."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wcwonline.org/WRB-Issues/the-meaning-of-marilyn|title=The Meaning of Marilyn|last=Banner|first=Lois|publisher=Women's Review of Books|accessdate=April 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501093607/https://www.wcwonline.org/WRB-Issues/the-meaning-of-marilyn|archive-date=May 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Monroe herself stated that she was influenced by West, learning "a few tricks from her—that impression of laughing at, or mocking, her own sexuality".{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=63 for West|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=325}} She studied comedy in classes by mime and dancer Lotte Goslar, famous for her comic stage performances, and Goslar also instructed her on film sets.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=170–171}} In ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'', one of the films in which she played an archetypal dumb blonde, Monroe had the sentence "I can be smart when it's important, but most men don't like it" added to her character's lines.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=201}}

}}According to Dyer, Monroe became "virtually a household name for sex" in the 1950s and "her image has to be situated in the flux of ideas about morality and sexuality that characterised the Fifties in America", such as [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] ideas about sex, the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey report]] (1953), and [[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' (1963).{{sfnm|1a1=Dyer|1y=1986|1p=21|2a1=Dyer|2y=1991|2p=58}} By appearing vulnerable and unaware of her sex appeal, Monroe was the first sex symbol to present sex as natural and without danger, in contrast to the 1940s ''femme fatales''.{{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=29–39}} Spoto likewise describes her as the embodiment of "the postwar ideal of the American girl, soft, transparently needy, worshipful of men, naïve, offering sex without demands", which is echoed in [[Molly Haskell]]'s statement that "she was the Fifties fiction, the lie that a woman had no sexual needs, that she is there to cater to, or enhance, a man's needs."{{sfnm|1a1=Haskell|1y=1991|1p=256|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2p=249}} Monroe's contemporary Norman Mailer wrote that "Marilyn suggested sex might be difficult and dangerous with others, but ice cream with her", while [[Groucho Marx]] characterized her as "[[Mae West]], [[Theda Bara]], and [[Little Bo Peep|Bo Peep]] all rolled into one".{{sfnm|1a1=Dyer|1y=1986|1p=39|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=82}} According to Haskell, due to her status as a sex symbol, Monroe was less popular with women than with men, as they "couldn't identify with her and didn't support her", although this would change after her death.{{sfn|Dyer|1986|p=57, quoting Haskell}}

Dyer has also argued that Monroe's blonde hair became her defining feature because it made her "racially unambiguous" and exclusively white just as the [[civil rights movement]] was beginning, and that she should be seen as emblematic of racism in twentieth-century popular culture.{{sfn|Dyer|1986|p=40}} Banner agreed that it may not be a coincidence that Monroe launched a trend of platinum blonde actresses during the civil rights movement, but has also criticized Dyer, pointing out that in her highly publicized private life, Monroe associated with people who were seen as "[[white ethnic]]s", such as Joe DiMaggio ([[Italian-American]]) and Arthur Miller (Jewish).{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=254–256}} According to Banner, she sometimes challenged prevailing racial norms in her publicity photographs; for example, in an image featured in ''Look'' in 1951, she was shown in revealing clothes while practicing with [[African-American]] singing coach [[Phil Moore (jazz musician)|Phil Moore]].{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=184}}

Monroe was perceived as a specifically American star, "a national institution as well known as hot dogs, apple pie, or baseball" according to ''Photoplay''.{{sfn|Banner|2012|p=8}} Banner calls her the symbol of [[populuxe]], a star whose joyful and glamorous public image "helped the nation cope with its paranoia in the 1950s about the [[Cold War]], the atom bomb, and the totalitarian communist Soviet Union".{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=239–240}} Historian Fiona Handyside writes that the French female audiences associated whiteness/blondness with American modernity and cleanliness, and so Monroe came to symbolize a modern, "liberated" woman whose life takes place in the public sphere.{{sfn|Handyside|2010|pp=1–16}} Film historian [[Laura Mulvey]] has written of her as an endorsement for American consumer culture:

{{quote|If America was to export the democracy of glamour into post-war, impoverished Europe, the movies could be its shop window&nbsp;... Marilyn Monroe, with her all American attributes and streamlined sexuality, came to epitomise in a single image this complex interface of the economic, the political, and the erotic. By the mid 1950s, she stood for a brand of classless glamour, available to anyone using American cosmetics, nylons and peroxide.{{sfn|Handyside|2010|p=2, quoting Mulvey}}}}

Twentieth Century-Fox further profited from Monroe's popularity by cultivating several lookalike actresses, such as [[Jayne Mansfield]] and [[Sheree North]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=396|2a1=Belton|2y=2005|2p=103}} Other studios also attempted to create their own Monroes: [[Universal Pictures]] with [[Mamie Van Doren]],{{sfn|Spoto|2001|p=396}} Columbia Pictures with [[Kim Novak]],{{sfn|Solomon|2010|p=110}} and [[The Rank Organisation]] with [[Diana Dors]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/05/from-the-archives-diana-dors-obituary|title=From the archives: Sex Symbol Diana Dors Dies at 52|newspaper=The Guardian|date=May 5, 1964|accessdate=September 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925131302/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/05/from-the-archives-diana-dors-obituary|archive-date=September 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Due to the contrast between her stardom and troubled private life, Monroe is closely linked to broader discussions about modern phenomena such as mass media, fame, and consumer culture.{{sfn|Hamscha|2013|pp=119–129}} According to academic Susanne Hamscha, Monroe has continued relevance to ongoing discussions about modern society, and she is "never completely situated in one time or place" but has become "a surface on which narratives of American culture can be (re-)constructed", and "functions as a cultural type that can be reproduced, transformed, translated into new contexts, and enacted by other people".{{sfn|Hamscha|2013|pp=119–129}} Similarly, Banner has called Monroe the "eternal shapeshifter" who is re-created by "each generation, even each individual&nbsp;... to their own specifications".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-xpm-2012-aug-05-la-oe-0805-banner-marilyn-monroe-icon-biography-20120805-story.html|title=Marilyn Monroe, the Eternal Shape Shifter|last=Banner|first=Lois|date=August 5, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|accessdate=August 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190517063539/https://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-xpm-2012-aug-05-la-oe-0805-banner-marilyn-monroe-icon-biography-20120805-story.html|archive-date=May 17, 2019|url-status=live|ref=none}}</ref>

Monroe remains a cultural icon, but critics are divided on her legacy as an actress. [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] called her body of work "insubstantial"<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/105847/the-inscrutable-life-and-death-marilyn-monroe|title=The Inscrutable Life and Death of Marilyn Monroe|last=Thomson|first=David|authorlink=David Thomson (film critic)|date=August 6, 2012|journal=New Republic|accessdate=August 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210190429/https://newrepublic.com/article/105847/the-inscrutable-life-and-death-marilyn-monroe|archive-date=December 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Pauline Kael]] wrote that she could not act, but rather "used her lack of an actress's skills to amuse the public. She had the wit or crassness or desperation to turn cheesecake into acting—and vice versa; she did what others had the 'good taste' not to do".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/04/reviews/mailer-marilyn.html|title=Marilyn: A Rip-Off With Genius|last=Kael|first=Pauline|authorlink=Pauline Kael|date=July 22, 1973|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325182658/https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/04/reviews/mailer-marilyn.html|archive-date=March 25, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In contrast, [[Peter Bradshaw]] wrote that Monroe was a talented comedian who "understood how comedy achieved its effects",<ref name="bradshaw">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/09/cannes-marilyn-monroe|title=Cannes and the Magic of Marilyn Monroe|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Bradshaw|date=May 9, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|accessdate=August 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923131249/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/09/cannes-marilyn-monroe|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that "Monroe's eccentricities and neuroses on sets became notorious, but studios put up with her long after any other actress would have been blackballed because what they got back on the screen was magical".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-some-like-it-hot-1959|title=Some Like It Hot|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=January 9, 2000|publisher=Roger Ebert.com|accessdate=July 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725091543/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-some-like-it-hot-1959|archive-date=July 25, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Similarly, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] stated that "she subtly subverted the sexist content of her material" and that "the difficulty some people have discerning Monroe's intelligence as an actress seems rooted in the ideology of a repressive era, when superfeminine women weren't supposed to be smart".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/marilyn-monroes-brains/Content?oid=920660|title=Marilyn Monroe's Brains|last=Rosenbaum|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Rosenbaum|date=December 1, 2005|work=Chicago Reader|accessdate=August 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905085251/http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/marilyn-monroes-brains/Content?oid=920660|archive-date=September 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
