'''Mark William Calaway''' (born March 24, 1965), better known by the [[ring name]] '''The Undertaker''', is an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He is currently signed to [[WWE]]. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/steve-austin-wwe-network-broken-skull-sessions-1203398557/|title=Steve Austin to Launch New WWE Network Interview Series, Sets Undertaker as First Guest|last=Otterson|first=Joe|date=November 11, 2019|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> The Undertaker is a seven-time [[World heavyweight championship (professional wrestling)|world heavyweight champion]] in WWF/E, having held the [[WWE Championship|WWF/E Championship]] [[List of WWE Champions|four times]] and [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] [[List of World Heavyweight Champions (WWE)|three times]].

Calaway began his career in 1987, working as various [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmicks]] for [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) and other affiliate promotions, and he became [[USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship|USWA Unified World Heavyweight Champion]] and [[NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship|WCWA Texas Heavyweight Champion]] during this time. After signing with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1989, he had a brief stint in the mid-card as "Mean Mark" Callous, before joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1990.

Calaway was rebranded as "The Undertaker" in the WWF, and gained significant mainstream popularity as a [[Horror film|horror]]-themed, [[macabre]] entity who employed [[Fear mongering|scare tactics]] and held links to the [[supernatural]]. The longest-tenured wrestler in company history at 30 years, The Undertaker was one of the most prominent figures of the [[Attitude Era]], a boom period in the company's business in the latter 1990s. His character transitioned into a biker in the early 2000s, before returning to a refined version of his previous gimmick in 2004. The Undertaker is heavily associated with WWE's flagship annual event, [[WrestleMania]], where he became known for [[The Streak (wrestling)|The Streak]], a series of 21 straight victories, and he headlined the event on five occasions.{{Efn|The Undertaker headlined [[WrestleMania 13]], [[WrestleMania XXIV]], [[WrestleMania XXVI]], [[WrestleMania 33]], and [[WrestleMania 36]] (Part 1).}} He is also known for his pairing with his [[kayfabe|in-storyline]] half-brother [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], with whom he has alternatively [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] or [[tag team|teamed]] as [[The Brothers of Destruction]] since 1997. With Kane, he held the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF]] and [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]]s during [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] storyline. In 2020, it was assumed by some in the media that he had retired from the sport due to his comments in a documentary about his career.

In 1988, Calaway joined the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (which became part of the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA) after [[Jerry Jarrett]] bought WCCW and merged the two organizations into one), wrestling under several gimmicks. On February 2, 1989, managed by [[Dutch Mantel]], he was reintroduced as The Master of Pain, a character fresh out of the [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta]] after serving five years (much in [[solitary confinement]]) for killing two men in a fight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2548866-undertakers-early-career-a-reminder-of-how-vital-finding-the-right-gimmick-is|title=Undertaker's Early Career a Reminder of How Vital Finding the Right Gimmick Is|last=Dilbert|first=Ryan|website=Bleacher Report|language=en|access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref> After his second match the next week, he stayed in the ring by challenging USWA Unified World Heavyweight Champion [[Jerry Lawler]] to an impromptu match. The Master of Pain easily dominated Lawler until Mantel entered the ring and called him off. Lawler agreed to a title match and on April 1, The Master of Pain won his first [[professional wrestling championship]]. He held it for just over three weeks before Lawler became the first man to [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pin]] him, winning it back. While performing as The Punisher, Calaway won the WCWA Texas Heavyweight Championship on October 5, 1989, when [[Eric Embry]] forfeited the title.<ref name="wcwa">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/tx/tx-h.html|title=Texas Heavyweight Title history|publisher=Wrestling-Titles.com|accessdate=April 9, 2008}}</ref>

=== World Championship Wrestling (1989{{ndash}}1990) ===
In 1989, Calaway joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] and adopted the ring name "Mean Mark" Callous, a name devised for him by [[Terry Funk]].<ref name=FunkAutobiography>{{cite book|last1=Funk|first1=Terry|authorlink1=Terry Funk|last2=Williams|first2=Scott|title=Terry Funk: More Than Just Hardcore|year=2006|publisher=Sports Publishing|location=Champaign, IL|isbn=1-59670-159-5|page=198}}Retrieved on April 18, 2018</ref> He was portrayed as a morbid character; he wore predominantly black ring attire and was described by announcer [[Jim Ross]] as having a fondness for pet snakes and the music of [[Ozzy Osbourne]].<ref>''WCW/NWA Capital Combat'' (VHS). [[Turner Entertainment#Home video|Turner Home Entertainment]]. 1990.</ref> Callous was promptly drafted into [[The Skyscrapers]] [[tag team]] to replace a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|legitimately]] injured [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]] and he made his debut on January 3, 1990, in a match later televised against Agent Steel and Randy Harris.<ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com">http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw90.htm</ref> The new team gained some notoriety at ''[[Clash of the Champions X]]'' when they beat down [[The Road Warriors]] after their match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html#X|title=NWA Clash of the Champions Results (X)|accessdate=April 16, 2007|author=prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> However, Callous' partner [[Dan Spivey]] left WCW days before their [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|Chicago Street Fight]] against The Road Warriors at [[WrestleWar (1990)|WrestleWar]]. Callous and [[Mike Enos|a replacement masked Skyscraper]] were defeated in the [[Hardcore wrestling|street fight]] and the team broke up soon afterwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/w-war.html#90|title=NWA WrestleWar Results (1990)|accessdate=April 16, 2007|author=prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> Now a singles wrestler, Callous took on the guidance of [[Paul Heyman|Paul E. Dangerously]] (Paul Heyman) and defeated [[John Laurinaitis|Johnny Ace]] at [[Capital Combat]] and [[Brian Pillman]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions XI: Coastal Crush]]''.

Calaway began to question his future in WCW after being told by [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#book|booker]] [[Ole Anderson]], during contract renewal talks, that nobody would ever pay money to watch him perform.<ref name="BSS"/> Callous wrestled [[Lex Luger]] for the [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Heavyweight Championship]] at [[The Great American Bash (1990)|The Great American Bash]], but was pinned. According to WWF/E executive [[Bruce Prichard]], "feelers" had already been sent out to the WWF by Heyman: Calaway wrestled the match with a dislocated hip knowing that he was being watched by [[Vince McMahon]]. McMahon initially did not express interest, but Prichard encouraged him to speak with Calaway when WCW traveled to [[New Jersey]] for a house show in the [[New Jersey Meadowlands|Meadowlands]]<ref name="prichard14"/> on August 24.<ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com" /> The meeting between the two went well<ref name="prichard14"/> and Calaway gave notice to WCW on August 27.<ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com" /> His final match was on September 7 at a ''[[WCW WorldWide|WorldWide]]'' taping in [[Amarillo, Texas]] in which he defeated Dave Johnson.<ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com" />

During his time in WCW, Calaway briefly wrestled in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) as "Punisher" Dice Morgan. After leaving WCW, he briefly returned to the USWA to participate in a tournament to determine the new USWA Unified World Heavyweight Champion; he defeated [[Bill Dundee]] in the first round, but lost to Jerry Lawler in the quarterfinals.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE ===
==== Debut and early feuds (1990–1991) ====
In October 1990, Calaway signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He made his debut as Kane the Undertaker at a taping of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'' on November 19, 1990. Calaway made his official on-camera debut on November 22 at [[Survivor Series (1990)|Survivor Series]] as a villainous character when he was the mystery partner of Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Team.<ref name=pwi89>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. "Wrestling's historical cards", p. 88–89.</ref> Approximately one minute into the match, The Undertaker eliminated [[Koko B. Ware]] with his finisher, the ''[[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Kneeling reverse piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]]''. He also eliminated [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] before being [[Professional wrestling#Countout|counted out]]; however, his team won the match with DiBiase being the sole survivor. During the match, Calaway was referred to as The Undertaker, omitting the name 'Kane', which was dropped shortly after the event (and seven years later was given to another wrestler who eventually became Undertaker's [[Kane (wrestler)|younger brother]] of the same name). At the same time, The Undertaker switched [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managers]] from Brother Love to [[Paul Bearer]] – a [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[ghost]]ly character, almost always seen bearing an [[urn]], which he used to revive The Undertaker's strength whenever Undertaker fell victim to his opponents. Undertaker placed his defeated opponents (almost always [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobbers]]) in a [[body bag]] and carried them to the back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestling.about.com/od/thewrestlers/tp/scarywrestlers.htm|title=About.com: Top 10 Scariest Wrestlers|publisher=Prowrestling.about.com|date=September 24, 2010|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref> Throughout the end of 1990, The Undertaker mostly picked up [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#squash|squash]] victories against jobbers on Superstars of Wrestling and Wrestling Challenge tapings. He was a participant in the [[Royal Rumble (1991)|1991]] [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]] which was won by [[Hulk Hogan]]. He continued picking up victories in squash matches leading up to his first [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] in the WWF with [[Jimmy Snuka|"Superfly" Jimmy Snuka]].

==== WWF Champion (1991–1994) ====
He made his WrestleMania debut at [[WrestleMania VII]] on March 24, 1991, quickly defeating "Superfly" Jimmy Snuka.<ref name=legacy>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/undertaker/wrestlemanialegacy/|title=WrestleMania Legacy|accessdate=July 10, 2008|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> He began his first major feud with [[The Ultimate Warrior]] when he attacked Warrior and locked him in an airtight [[casket]] on the set of Paul Bearer's ''Funeral Parlor'' interview segment. He would later lose to Warrior in the first-ever body bag challenge in WWF history. At [[King of the Ring]] 1991, Undertaker defeated Animal in a qualifying match before fighting Sid Vicious to a double [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] in the Semi-Final, which saw both men eliminated from the [[King of the Ring tournament]]. The Undertaker defeated [[Hulk Hogan]] to win his first WWF Championship at [[Survivor Series (1991)|Survivor Series]] with the help of [[Ric Flair]] and thus became the youngest WWF Champion in history, until having this record broken by [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] in April 1993 at [[WrestleMania IX]].<ref name=pwi90>PWI Staff. 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. "Wrestling's historical cards", p. 89–90.</ref> WWF President [[Jack Tunney]] ordered a rematch for [[This Tuesday in Texas]] six days later, where he lost the title back to Hogan.<ref name=pwi90 /> However, due to the controversial endings of the two title matches between The Undertaker and Hogan, the title was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vacant|vacated]] by Tunney. The title was awarded to Ric Flair as the winner of the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992]] Royal Rumble match.

In February 1992, The Undertaker's ally [[Jake "The Snake" Roberts]] tried to attack [["Macho Man" Randy Savage]]'s manager/wife [[Miss Elizabeth]] with a steel chair when Undertaker stopped him, becoming a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] for the first time. The turn was solidified on the February 29 episode of ''Superstars'', when Roberts confronted The Undertaker on the ''Funeral Parlor'' set over that incident (aired on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]''). After demanding to know whose side The Undertaker was on and getting the reply "Not yours!", Roberts attacked both Bearer and The Undertaker, only for Undertaker to stand his ground and run Roberts off. The Undertaker defeated Roberts at [[WrestleMania VIII]].<ref name=legacy /> He then feuded extensively with wrestlers managed by [[Harvey Wippleman]] throughout 1992 and 1993, such as [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]] and [[Jorge González (wrestler)|Giant González]]. Also at this time, he headlined the first episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' on January 11, 1993, with a victory over [[Damien Demento]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} According to Calaway, working with González was "It was survival every night trying to figure out what he could do" and "took years off my career".<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYjd7StlJHs&feature=emb_title</ref>  He faced González at WrestleMania IX, which is notable as Undertaker's only disqualification win at WrestleMania after the use of [[chloroform]]. His rivalry with Yokozuna culminated in a WWF Championship [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|casket match]] at the [[Royal Rumble (1994)|Royal Rumble]] in January 1994. During the match, champion Yokozuna sealed The Undertaker in the casket with the assistance of several other villainous Wippleman-managed wrestlers to win the match. The Undertaker appeared from inside the casket on the video screen, representing his spirit, warning that he would return.<ref name=pwi92>PWI Staff. 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. "Wrestling's historical cards", p. 92–94.</ref> The Undertaker did not appear in the WWF for seven months after his loss to Yokozuna. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/wwe-summerslam-john-cena-brock-lesnar-pay-per-view/|title=What's at Stake When John Cena Wrestles Brock Lesnar at 'SummerSlam'|last=Shoemaker|first=David|date=August 14, 2014|publisher=[[Grantland]]|access-date=February 23, 2015}}</ref>

==== The original Deadman Era (1994–1996) ====
[[File:Paul Bearer in 1996.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Bearer]] betrayed The Undertaker by hitting him with the [[urn]] he is seen carrying here]]
During his absence, the WWF promoted his return by showing video clips of people who claimed to have seen The Undertaker. After [[WrestleMania X]], [[Ted DiBiase]] introduced an Undertaker back to the WWF. This Undertaker, however, played by Calaway's real-life cousin, [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]], was an impostor Undertaker (dubbed "The Underfaker" by fans) and led to the return of the real Undertaker in the [[SummerSlam (1994)|SummerSlam]] main event, appearing as a new version of his Deadman persona, represented now by cool colors and replacing gray with purple. The Undertaker defeated the impostor after three ''Tombstone Piledrivers,'' and rolled him out in the casket that he'd brought to ringside.<ref name=pwi92 /> At [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker defeated Yokozuna in a casket match rematch. Throughout most of 1995, Undertaker feuded with members of Ted DiBiase's [[Million Dollar Corporation]]. At [[WrestleMania XI]], while The Undertaker was facing [[King Kong Bundy]], [[The Godfather (wrestler)|Kama]] stole the urn and antagonized him by melting it into a large gold necklace.<ref name=pwi92 /> In August, Undertaker defeated Kama in a casket match at [[SummerSlam (1995)|SummerSlam]].<ref name=pwi92 /> Several weeks later, Undertaker injured his [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbital bone]] near his eye, forcing a period of absence for surgery, until his return at [[Survivor Series (1995)|Survivor Series]].

The Undertaker returned in November at Survivor Series, wearing a ''[[The Phantom of the Opera|Phantom of the Opera]]''-like, gray upper-face mask.<ref name=pwi92 /> In the main event of the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]] in January 1996, The Undertaker was unmasked in a WWF Championship match against [[Bret Hart]], but [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] interfered during the match, costing The Undertaker the championship.<ref name=pwi95>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. "Wrestling's historical cards" (p.95)</ref> A rematch for the title on the February 5 episode of ''Raw'' saw similar interference.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} At that month's [[In Your House 6|In Your House: Rage in the Cage]], while Diesel was facing Hart in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Steel cages|steel cage match]], The Undertaker delivered a surprise attack, emerging from a hole he had ripped through the ring canvas and dragging Diesel with him down under, allowing Hart the victory.<ref name=pwi95 /> After several weeks of more tit for tat between Diesel and The Undertaker, the feud culminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Singles match|singles match]] between the two at [[WrestleMania XII]], where Undertaker was victorious.<ref name=legacy />

The Undertaker's next feud started the next night on ''Raw'', when [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] made his debut and interfered in Undertaker's match against [[John Layfield|Justin "Hawk" Bradshaw]]. For the next few months, Mankind ambushed and cost The Undertaker several matches.<ref name=pwi95 /> The feud intensified and they began taking their battles into crowds, backstage areas and in the boiler rooms of different arenas. Mankind cost The Undertaker the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] at [[In Your House 8: Beware of Dog]], assisting champion [[Goldust]] to victory. As a result, the first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Location-based variations|Boiler Room Brawl]] was booked between the two at [[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam]]. During the match, when Undertaker reached for Paul Bearer's urn, Bearer hit him with it, betraying The Undertaker and allowing [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] to "incapacitate" him with the [[Professional wrestling holds#Mandible claw|mandible claw]], giving him the win.<ref name=pwi95 /> After Bearer's betrayal, The Undertaker took his rivalry with Mankind to a new level, resulting in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Buried Alive match]] in the main event of [[In Your House 11: Buried Alive]], where The Undertaker won the match after a [[chokeslam]] into the open grave. However, after interference from [[Terry Gordy|The Executioner]], as well as the help of several other wrestlers, The Undertaker was ultimately "[[Premature burial|buried alive]]".<ref name=pwi95 />

After being buried alive, The Undertaker returned at [[Survivor Series (1996)|Survivor Series]] again pitting him against Mankind, but with a unique stipulation; hanging {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} above the ring was Paul Bearer, enclosed in a steel cage. If Undertaker won the match, he would be able to get his hands on Bearer. Even though The Undertaker won the match, interference from The Executioner enabled Bearer to escape Undertaker's clutches.<ref name=pwi97>PWI Staff. 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. "Wrestling's historical cards" (p. 96–97).</ref> It was also at this event that Undertaker had developed a more informal, casual "Deadman" incarnation than before. In this then-new form, he took on a Gothic, brash and [[Rebellion|rebelling]] persona (perhaps to better fit in with the then-budding, more adult-oriented Attitude Era). In this form, he proclaimed himself as "The Lord of Darkness".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Following Survivor Series, The Undertaker briefly turned his attention to The Executioner, who had been interfering in his matches since his arrival. At [[In Your House 12: It's Time]], The Undertaker defeated The Executioner in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Armageddon rules match]].<ref name=pwi97 /> He then moved on to feud with [[Big Van Vader|Vader]], whom he faced in January 1997 at the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|Royal Rumble]] in a singles match, which Undertaker lost after Bearer interfered on behalf of his new protégé.<ref name=pwi97 /> The two then clashed in the Royal Rumble match itself as they made it to the final moments of the match, but both were eliminated by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], who had crept back into the match after his elimination was unseen. He faced both Vader and Austin in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination match types|four-corners elimination match]] for the vacant WWF Championship at [[In Your House 13: Final Four]], but Bret Hart won.<ref>{{cite web|title=Final Four results|date=February 16, 1997|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/miscppvs1990s.html#13|accessdate=December 7, 2011|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}</ref> However, the following month, The Undertaker managed to win the title for the second time by defeating Sycho Sid at WrestleMania 13.<ref name=pwi98>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts.

In May 1997, Paul Bearer attempted to rejoin The Undertaker, using the [[ultimatum]] of revealing The Undertaker's "deepest, darkest secret" to the world. Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family [[funeral home]] business when he was a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (the entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family. It was during this time that The Undertaker also made an appearance in [[Michinoku Pro Wrestling]], defeating [[Jinsei Shinzaki|Hakushi]] in a singles match.<ref name=PWInsiderTakervs.Hakushi>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=22474&p=1|title=PWInsider.com — Undertaker in Japan|accessdate=March 19, 2013|publisher=PWInsider.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2lcw1_michinoku-pro-undertaker-vs-hakushi_sport#.UUipFBzry5c|title=Michinoku Pro: Undertaker vs. Hakushi|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Undertaker standing 1997.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Undertaker in September 1997]]
Concurrent to the deep, dark secret storyline directed by Bearer, Undertaker began a new rivalry at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] when [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|special guest referee]] [[Shawn Michaels]] accidentally hit The Undertaker with a steel chair shot meant for Bret Hart, costing Undertaker the WWF Championship.<ref name=pwi98 /> After a double count-out draw during [[Ground Zero: In Your House]], Undertaker challenged Michaels to the first [[Hell in a Cell|Hell in a Cell match]] at [[Badd Blood: In Your House]]. During this match, The Undertaker's storyline half-brother Kane finally made his debut under the control of Paul Bearer, ripping off the door to the cell and giving The Undertaker a ''Tombstone Piledriver'', Undertaker's trademark finisher, allowing Michaels to pin him.<ref name=pwi98 /> As the storyline progressed through Bearer, Kane challenged The Undertaker, but Undertaker consistently refused to fight his half-brother. The Undertaker's final encounter with Michaels was in a casket match at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]. The week before on ''Raw'', Kane had seemed to ally with his brother against Michaels' [[D-Generation X]]; however, at the event, Kane trapped him in the coffin, padlocking the casket lid and setting it ablaze which again gave Michaels the victory. The Undertaker, however, had disappeared when the casket lid was reopened.<ref name=pwi100>PWI Staff. 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. "Wrestling's historical cards" (p. 100–101).</ref> After a two-month hiatus, The Undertaker returned and defeated Kane at [[WrestleMania XIV]].<ref name=pwi100 /> The two had a rematch, the first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Inferno match|Inferno match]], one month later at [[Unforgiven: In Your House]], which The Undertaker won by setting Kane's right arm on fire.<ref name=pwi100 />

The Undertaker's feud with Mankind was concluded afterward and they [[The Undertaker vs. Mankind (Hell in a Cell match)|faced each other in a Hell in a Cell match]] at [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]]. During the match, The Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring which legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious. Mankind also used thumbtacks in the match and was hit by a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] and another chokeslam onto them before Undertaker won the match with the ''Tombstone Piledriver''.<ref name=pwi100 /> At [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kane and Mankind to win the WWF World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=pwi100 /> The Undertaker and Austin's reign as [[World tag team championship|tag team champions]] lasted for only two weeks, as Kane and Mankind regained the titles on the August 10 episode of ''Raw''.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The Undertaker then became the number one contender for the renamed WWF Championship at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], now held by Austin. Shortly before SummerSlam, however, The Undertaker revealed that he and Kane were working together as brothers. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane that he did not want him to interfere in the match with Austin and even though The Undertaker lost the match, he handed Austin his [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] back after the match in a show of respect.<ref name=pwi100 /> In September, the storyline continued and The Undertaker began to show some villainous characteristics when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for Mr. McMahon. At [[Breakdown: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|double chokeslam]], so the title was vacated by McMahon.<ref name=pwi100 /> This event led to a match at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]] between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with the chair. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them.<ref name=pwi100 /> Finally, The Undertaker became a villain the next night on ''Raw'' for the first time in over six years, reconciling with Bearer and claiming that he and Bearer would unleash their "[[The Ministry of Darkness|Ministry of Darkness]]" on the World Wrestling Federation. As part of this new storyline, he admitted that he had indeed set the fire that killed his parents, for which he had previously blamed Kane.<ref>{{Youtube|uNCRvCc4XY0|"Undertaker admits to setting Kane on fire"}}</ref>

==== Ministry of Darkness (1998–1999) ====
{{Main|Ministry of Darkness}}
After [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] and had his druids chain Austin to his symbol, raising it high into the arena.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} However, The Undertaker lost the match after Kane interfered.<ref name=pwi102>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. "Wrestling's historical cards" (p. 102).</ref>

After building up to his second villainous run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 – the dark priest who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often claimed to be invoking and taking orders from a "Higher Power". Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne that was specially designed into his character symbol. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various [[incantation]]s and [[magic word]]s with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Christian Cage|Christian]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]), [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] (Bradshaw and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], Undertaker expressed a desire to take control of the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]]. The two faced off in a Hell in a Cell match at [[WrestleMania XV]], which Undertaker won.<ref name="Wrestlemania XV Results">{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm15/results/|title=WrestleMania XV Results|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}</ref> At [[Backlash: In Your House]], Undertaker defeated Corporation member [[Ken Shamrock]] after interference from Ministry member Bradshaw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/april/1999.htm|title=Backlash '99 Results|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>

Thereafter, The Undertaker kidnapped [[Stephanie McMahon]], forcing Mr. McMahon to enter into a reluctant alliance with his longtime nemesis Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Undertaker attempted to [[Marriage|marry]] Stephanie before sacrificing her in an [[wikt:eldritch|eldritch]] ceremony conducted by Paul Bearer, but Austin was able to rescue her.<ref name="Backlash Slam!">{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/apr26_backlash.html|title=Backlash: Austin wins, Stephanie abducted|date=April 26, 1999|work=Slam!

"Wrestling's historical cards" (p.103)</ref> The Ministry eventually merged with Shane McMahon's Corporation alliance to form [[The Corporate Ministry]].

The Undertaker then began a storyline where he teamed with [[Big Show]] in a tag team known as "The Unholy Alliance", which held the WWF World Tag Team Championship twice. After their victory at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], The Undertaker suffered a groin tear and was seen [[limp]]ing in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

To compensate for his lack of physical activity, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making [[Know-it-all|smart-aleck]] remarks and performing commentary. In September 1999, on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Mr. McMahon threatened that he would remove Undertaker from the [[Unforgiven (1999)|Unforgiven]] main event if he refused to participate in a casket match against [[Triple H]]. Undertaker retorted that he did not care and maybe he would not be participating in anything, thus walking out of the WWF.<ref name="WWF SmackDown! - 09/23/1999">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/tv/smackdown/990923.htm|title=WWF SmackDown results|publisher=PWWEW.net|accessdate=March 21, 2013|date=September 23, 1999}}</ref> In reality, Calaway went on a hiatus from the WWF in order to treat his groin injury.

==== American Bad Ass (2000–2001) ====
[[File:the Undertaker at WrestleMania XIX.jpg|upright|thumb|The Undertaker at [[WrestleMania XIX]]]]
In May 2000, The Undertaker made his return under a new character, the American Bad Ass. When Undertaker returned near the end of the Iron Man match between Triple H and The Rock at [[Judgment Day (2000)|Judgment Day]], he took out all the members of the [[McMahon-Helmsley Faction]], which caused him to once again be a fan favorite.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} He also targeted their leader, then WWF Champion Triple H. At the [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]] pay-per-view, The Undertaker teamed with The Rock and Kane to defeat the team of Triple H, Shane McMahon and Vince McMahon.<ref name=pwi106 /> Afterward, he was booked to team with Kane to contend for the WWF World Tag Team Championship. They defeated [[Edge and Christian]], earning the right to face them the following week for the championship, which Edge and Christian retained. Kane betrayed The Undertaker by hitting him with a chokeslam twice, with the second one putting The Undertaker through the ring, on the August 14 episode of ''Raw''.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} This incident led to another match between the two at [[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam]], which ended in a [[Professional wrestling#No contest|no contest]] as Kane ran from the ring area after The Undertaker removed Kane's mask.<ref name=pwi106>PWI Staff. 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts.

In 2001, The Undertaker reunited with Kane as [[The Brothers of Destruction]], challenging for the WWF World Tag Team Championship once again. They received a title shot at [[No Way Out (2001)|No Way Out]], facing Edge and Christian and then-champions [[The Dudley Boyz]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Tables match|tables match]], but they were not successful.<ref name=pwi107 /> The Undertaker then went on to defeat Triple H at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]].<ref name=legacy /> He and Kane continued a storyline that focused on Triple H, who formed a "surprise alliance" with then WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Brothers of Destruction were granted an opportunity to face Triple H and Austin for their titles. After The Undertaker and Kane won the WWF World Tag Team Championship from Edge and Christian,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/|title=World Tag Team Title History|publisher=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=June 21, 2009}}</ref> Triple H pinned Kane after attacking him with a sledgehammer at [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]], where The Brothers of Destruction lost their championships.<ref name=pwi108>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts.

==== Big Evil (2001–2003) ====
After [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]] was defeated, The Undertaker became a villain once again by forcing commentator Jim Ross to kiss Vince McMahon's buttocks.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} This was the beginning of a new persona for The Undertaker, as he cut his long hair short and called himself "Big Evil".

The Undertaker's next storyline began at the [[Royal Rumble (2002)|Royal Rumble]] in January 2002, when [[Maven Huffman|Maven]] eliminated him by hitting him with a [[dropkick]] from behind. Subsequently, The Undertaker eliminated Maven in return and brutally assaulted him backstage.<ref name=pwi110 /> On an episode of ''SmackDown!'', The Rock mentioned The Undertaker's elimination at the Royal Rumble, angering Undertaker, who responded by costing The Rock the number one contendership for the Undisputed WWF Championship.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|page=52}}</ref> The storyline continued when The Rock cost The Undertaker his match with Maven for the Hardcore Championship.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|page=56}}</ref> The two faced off at [[No Way Out (2002)|No Way Out]], where The Undertaker lost due to interference from Ric Flair.<ref name=pwi110 /> This interference began a storyline with Flair, who declined a challenge to wrestle Undertaker at [[WrestleMania X8]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|pages=79–80}}</ref> As a result, Undertaker assaulted his son [[David Flair]].<ref name=yearbook>{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|pages=80–81}}</ref> Flair eventually accepted the match after The Undertaker threatened to inflict the same punishment on Flair's [[Charlotte Flair|daughter]].<ref name=yearbook /> A no disqualification stipulation was added to the match and The Undertaker defeated Flair.<ref name=legacy />

After the storyline with Flair, The Undertaker was drafted to the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw brand]] after WWF split its roster into two [[WWE Brand Extension|brands]] and defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin at [[Backlash (2002)|Backlash]] to become the number one contender to the Undisputed WWF Championship. Later that night, he helped Hollywood Hulk Hogan win the title against then-champion Triple H.<ref name=pwi110 /> The Undertaker then defeated Hogan for the renamed WWE Undisputed Championship at [[Judgment Day (2002)|Judgment Day]]. The next night on ''Raw'', The Undertaker lost to Rob Van Dam for the WWE Undisputed Championship; however, [[Ric Flair]] restarted the match and The Undertaker regained the championship.<ref name=pwi111>PWI Staff. 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. "Wrestling's historical cards" (p.110–111)</ref> On the July 1 episode of ''Raw'', The Undertaker became a fan favorite again after defeating [[Jeff Hardy]] in a [[ladder match]] and raising Hardy's hand as a show of respect. The Undertaker, however, lost the title at [[Vengeance (2002)|Vengeance]] to The Rock in a triple threat match that also involved Kurt Angle.<ref name=pwi111 /> On the August 29 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Undertaker was moved to the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown! brand]] (where he remained until the first brand extension ended in 2011), alongside former Raw talent [[Brock Lesnar]], [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Eddie Guerrero]]. Undertaker defeated Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle in a triple threat match to become the #1 contender for the renamed WWE Championship and challenged Brock Lesnar for the title at [[Unforgiven (2002)|Unforgiven]] that ended in a double disqualification.<ref name=pwi111 /> Their feud carried over to [[No Mercy (2002)|No Mercy]] in a Hell in a Cell match, which The Undertaker performed in the match with a legitimately broken hand and eventually lost to the champion.<ref name=pwi111 />

The Undertaker took a break after The Big Show threw him off the stage, sparking a feud.<ref>{{cite news|last=McAvennie|first=Michael|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|page=288}}</ref> The Undertaker returned at the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|Royal Rumble]] in January 2003.<ref name=pwi112>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts.

Over the remainder of the year, The Undertaker entered a brief feud with [[John Cena]] and was booked to have two WWE Championship opportunities.

==== Return of The Deadman (2004–2007) ====
[[File:Undertaker2.jpg|thumb|left|The Undertaker, awakening the arena lights as he enters the ring]]
In the storyline leading up to [[WrestleMania XX]], Kane was haunted by vignettes proclaiming The Undertaker's return. The first was during the [[Royal Rumble (2004)|Royal Rumble]] when The Undertaker's bells tolled, distracting Kane and allowing Booker T to eliminate him.<ref name=pwi114 /> Accompanied by Paul Bearer, The Undertaker returned as a hybrid version of The Deadman at WrestleMania XX and defeated Kane.<ref name=pwi115>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts.

In one of the most controversial moments in the WWE, on the episode of ''SmackDown!'' taped on July 4, 2005, the SmackDown! [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General managers 2|General Manager]] [[Theodore Long|Theodore "Teddy" Long]] put [[Muhammad Hassan (wrestler)|Muhammad Hassan]] in a match against Undertaker at [[The Great American Bash (2005)|The Great American Bash]] and placed [[Shawn Daivari|Daivari]] in a match that night against The Undertaker, who quickly defeated Daivari. After the match, Hassan began to "pray" on the ramp, summoning five masked men, dressed in black shirts, ski-masks and camouflage pants. Armed with clubs and a [[piano wire]], the masked men beat and choked The Undertaker and Hassan put The Undertaker in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Camel clutch|camel clutch]]. Afterward, the masked men lifted Daivari above their heads and carried him away. Three days later, the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings]] took place.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The footage aired unedited on [[UPN]] in the [[United States]] and on [[Sportsnet 360|The Score]] in [[Canada]] with an advisory warning shown several times during the broadcast.

[[File:Taker-WM22.jpg|thumb|right|The Undertaker retaining his undefeated Streak at [[WrestleMania 22]]]]
In January 2006 at the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|Royal Rumble]], The Undertaker returned during Kurt Angle's celebration of his World Heavyweight Championship defense against [[Mark Henry]] on a horse-drawn cart, signalling for a title shot. As part of their storyline feud, The Undertaker lost his match with Angle at [[No Way Out (2006)|No Way Out]] after a 30-minute match. Undertaker cornered Angle after the match and told him he was not finished with him; however, during a rematch on ''SmackDown!'', Henry attacked The Undertaker from behind, costing him the title. This led to The Undertaker challenging Henry to a casket match at [[WrestleMania 22]] and Henry – like Orton a year before – vowed to end Undertaker's WrestleMania winning Streak. The Undertaker defeated Henry to become 14–0 at WrestleMania. During a rematch on the next episode of ''SmackDown!'', [[The Great Khali]] made his debut and assaulted The Undertaker to transition into a new storyline.

==== Potential retirement (2020–present) ====

==Professional wrestling style and persona==
The original Deadman character depicted him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[Funeral director|mortician]] dressed in a [[trench coat]], gray-striped tie and gray-ringed, black [[stetson hat]] with gray gloves and [[Spats (footwear)|boot spats]]. He was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#no-sell|not selling]] his opponents' attacks. He was managed by Paul Bearer, who used an urn to give Undertaker supernatural powers. During his early years, he used the rendition of the [[Funeral march]] by [[Frédéric Chopin]] as his entrance theme. WWF composer Jim Johnson changed the Chopin march to create a new theme, the Graveyard Symphony.<ref>https://superluchas.com/jim-johnston-habla-del-proceso-tras-el-tema-de-entrada-de-the-undertaker/</ref>

When he made his return in 2000, he abandoned the somber mortician-themed attires, his [[Funeral march|funeral dirge ring music]], allusions to the supernatural and the accompanying morbid theatrics. In place of this, he took on a biker identity, riding to the ring on a motorcycle and wearing sunglasses and bandanas to the ring. His [[Music in professional wrestling|entrance music]] was replaced with popular rock songs of the time, like [[Limp Bizkit]]'s "[[Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)]]" and [[Kid Rock]]'s "[[American Bad Ass]]" (from which the name of The Undertaker's new gimmick originated), though it was accompanied by the characteristic opening bell of The Undertaker's original theme.

In 2020, Undertaker started a feud with AJ Styles. Styles claimed that, in the last months, Undertaker lost his mystique because he broke kayfabe in social media and shoot interviews. At WrestleMania 36, Undertaker presented a new character called "The Unholy Trinity", a mix of the supernatural, the American Bad Ass characters and the real-life person.<ref>https://solowrestling.mundodeportivo.com/new/88886-undertaker-boneyard-match-por-mi-lo-hubiera-dejado-como-buried-alived</ref>

For several years, Calaway has been very hermetic about his personal life, being only presented in character to maintain the mystique of the gimmick.<ref>https://411mania.com/wrestling/undertaker-character-today/</ref> However, during the last years of his career, he allowed himself to be seen out of character, giving interviews as Mark Calaway and filming a documentary called ''The Last Ride''.<ref>https://www.prowrestlingsheet.com/undertaker-message-young-wrestlers/#.Xr3zZGgzaUk</ref><ref>https://solowrestling.mundodeportivo.com/new/89444-undertaker-the-last-ride-docuserie-va-impresionar</ref>
