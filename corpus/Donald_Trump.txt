Trump was born and raised in [[Queens]], a [[borough]] of New York City. He attended [[Fordham University]] for two years and received a [[bachelor's degree]] in economics from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]. He became president of [[Fred Trump|his father]]'s real-estate business in 1971, renamed it [[The Trump Organization]], and expanded its operations to building or renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started [[The Trump Organization#Other ventures and investments|various side ventures]], mostly by licensing his name. Trump and his businesses have been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal [[Legal affairs of Donald Trump|legal actions]], including six bankruptcies.

He produced and hosted ''[[The Apprentice (American TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', a [[reality television]] series, from 2003 to 2015. {{As of|April 2020}}, ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated his net worth to be $2.1&nbsp;billion.{{efn|name=Wealth}}<!-- Updated annually per [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 5.

[[Political positions of Donald Trump|Trump's political positions]] have been described as [[populist]], [[protectionist]], and [[nationalist]]. He entered the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential race]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and was elected in a surprise victory over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]], although [[List of United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|he lost the popular vote]].{{efn|name=electoral-college|Presidential elections in the United States are decided by the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]]. Each state names a number of electors equal to its representation in [[United States Congress|Congress]], and (in most states) all delegates vote for the winner of the local state vote. Consequently, it is possible for the [[president-elect]] to have received fewer votes from the country's total population (the popular vote). This situation has occurred [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|five times since 1824]].}} He became [[List of presidents of the United States by age|the oldest]] first-term U.S. president,{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]] was older upon his second-term inauguration.}} and the first without [[List of presidents of the United States by previous experience|prior military or government service]].

During [[Presidency of Donald Trump|his presidency]], Trump [[Executive Order 13769|ordered a travel ban]] on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after [[Legal challenges to the Trump travel ban|legal challenges]], the Supreme Court upheld [[Presidential Proclamation 9645|the policy's third revision]].<!-- DO NOT CHANGE this sentence IN ANY WAY without prior consensus; see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 23. --> He enacted [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|a tax-cut package]] for individuals and businesses, rescinding the [[individual shared responsibility provision|individual health insurance mandate]] penalty. He appointed [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In foreign policy, Trump has pursued an [[America First (policy)|America First]] agenda, withdrawing the U.S. from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] trade negotiations, the [[Paris Agreement]] on [[climate change]], and the [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]]. He [[Trump tariffs|imposed import tariffs]] which triggered [[China–United States trade war|a trade war with China]], [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel|recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel]], and [[American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War#Withdrawal from north Syria|withdrew U.S. troops from northern Syria]]. Trump met three times with North Korea's leader [[Kim Jong-un]], but talks on [[denuclearization]] broke down in 2019. Trump reacted slowly to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]; he minimized the threat, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials, and promoted false information about unproven treatments and the availability of testing. He [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|is seeking a second term]] as the Republican nominee in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]].

A [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|special counsel investigation]] led by [[Robert Mueller]] found that Trump and [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|his campaign]] welcomed and encouraged [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election]] under the belief that it would be politically advantageous, but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|criminal conspiracy]] or coordination with Russia.{{efn|name=coordination|"In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign 'coordinat[ed]'{{snd}}a term that appears in the appointment order{{snd}}with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, 'coordination' does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement{{snd}}tacit or express{{snd}}between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." [https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report], vol.

In 2011, the superintendent of the New York Military Academy at the time, Jeffrey Coverdale, ordered the headmaster of the school, Evan Jones, to give him Trump's academic records so he could keep them secret, according to Jones.

Trump is a skeptic of multilateral trade deals, as he believes they indirectly incentivize unfair trade practices that then tend to go unpoliced. He favors bilateral trade deals, as they allow one party to pull out if the other party is believed to be behaving unfairly.

On January 25, 2019, the Senate and the House unanimously approved a temporary funding bill that provided no funds for the wall but would provide delayed paychecks to government workers.

==== National emergency regarding the southern border ====

On February 15, 2019, after Trump received from Congress only $1.375&nbsp;billion for border fencing after demanding $5.7&nbsp;billion for the Trump wall, he declared a [[National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States]], in hopes of getting another $6.7&nbsp;billion without congressional approval, using funds for military construction, [[drug interdiction]], and money from the Treasury.<ref name=Wilkie/> In doing so, Trump acknowledged that he "didn't need to" declare a national emergency, but he "would rather do it much faster".<ref name=Wilkie/>

On December 3, 2019, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] published a report authored by Democrats on the committee, stating that "the impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection." The report said Trump withheld military aid and a White House invitation in order to influence Ukraine to announce investigations into Trump's political rivals. Furthermore, the report described Trump was the only U.S. president thus far to have "openly and indiscriminately" defied impeachment proceedings by telling his administration officials to ignore subpoenas for documents and testimony.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mascaro |first1=Lisa |last2=Jalonick |first2=Mary Clare |first3=Zeke |last3=Miller |first4=Colleen |last4=Long |first5=Eric |last5=Tucker |first6=Jill |last6=Colvin |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=House Releases 300-Page Report Outlining Evidence for Trump's Impeachment |url=https://time.com/5743345/house-releases-trump-impeachment-report/ |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Weiland |first1=Noah |title=Impeachment Briefing: The Democratic Report |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/politics/impeachment-briefing-the-democratic-report.html |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 3, 2019}}</ref><ref name="Intel-Report">{{Cite web |url=https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/the_trump-ukraine_impeachment_inquiry_report.pdf |title=Report of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Pursuant to H.
