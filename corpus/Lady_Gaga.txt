'''Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɛ|f|ən|i|_|ˌ|dʒ|ɜːr|m|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|t|ə}} {{respell|STEF|ən|ee|_|JUR|mə|NOT|ə}}) (born March 28, 1986), known professionally as '''Lady Gaga''', is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, and businesswoman. She is known for reinventing herself throughout her career and for her versatility in numerous areas of the entertainment industry. Gaga began performing as a teenager, singing at [[open mic]] nights and acting in school plays. She studied at [[Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21)|Collaborative Arts Project 21]], through [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], before dropping out to pursue a music career. When [[Def Jam Recordings]] canceled her contract, she worked as a songwriter for [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], where [[Akon]] helped her sign a joint deal with [[Interscope Records]] and his own label [[KonLive Distribution]] in 2007. She rose to prominence the following year with her debut album ''[[The Fame]]'' and its chart-topping singles "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" and "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]". The album was later reissued to include the EP ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009), which yielded the singles "[[Bad Romance]]", "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]", and "[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]".

Gaga's five succeeding studio albums have all debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Her second full-length album, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' (2011), explored [[electronic rock]] and [[techno-pop]] and sold [[Lists of fastest-selling albums|more than one million copies]] in its first week. Its [[Born This Way (song)|title track]] became the fastest-selling song on the [[iTunes Store]] with over a million downloads in less than a week. Following her [[Electronic dance music|EDM]]-influenced third album ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013), which yielded the single "[[Applause (Lady Gaga song)|Applause]]", Gaga transcended dance-pop and released a jazz album with [[Tony Bennett]], ''[[Cheek to Cheek (album)|Cheek to Cheek]]'' (2014), and the [[country pop]] and [[soft rock]] influenced album ''[[Joanne (album)|Joanne]]'' (2016). During this period, she also ventured into acting, playing leading roles in the miniseries ''[[American Horror Story: Hotel]]'' (2015–2016), for which she received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress]], and the critically acclaimed musical drama film ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (2018). She also contributed to the [[A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)|latter's soundtrack]], which spawned the chart-topping single "[[Shallow (Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper song)|Shallow]]", and made her the first woman to win an [[Academy Awards|Academy]], [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]], and [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] in one year. Gaga returned to her dance-pop roots with her sixth studio album ''[[Chromatica]]'' (2020), which featured the number-one single "[[Rain on Me (Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande song)|Rain on Me]]".

Having sold 124 million records as of 2014, Gaga is one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] and the fourth highest-earning female musician of the 2010s. [[List of awards and nominations received by Lady Gaga|Her achievements]] include various [[Guinness World Records]], 11 Grammy Awards and awards from the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]]. She has been declared ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Artist of the Year and [[Billboard Women in Music|Woman of the Year]], and included among ''[[Forbes]]''{{'}} power and earnings rankings. Gaga was ranked number four on [[VH1]]'s [[The Greatest (TV series)|Greatest Women in Music]] in 2012 and second on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s 2011 readers' poll of the most influential people of the past ten years. She is also known for her philanthropy and social activism, including her work related to mental health awareness and [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]].

In an article for ''Billboard'' by Rebecca Schiller in October 2018, the author traced back Gaga's videography from "Just Dance" till the release of ''A Star Is Born''. Schiller noted how, following the ''Artpop'' era, Gaga's stripped-down approach to music was reflected in the clips for the singles from ''Joanne'', taking the example of the music video of lead single "Perfect Illusion" where the singer "[ditched] the elaborate outfits for shorts and a tee-shirt as she performed the song at a desert party". It continued with her performances in the film as well as her stage persona.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8479080/lady-gaga-music-video-evolution|title=Every Lady Gaga Music Video From 2008 to Today: Watch Her Evolution|last=Schiller|first=Rebecca|date=October 10, 2018|access-date=January 31, 2019|magazine=Billboard|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202044753/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8479080/lady-gaga-music-video-evolution|archive-date=February 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
