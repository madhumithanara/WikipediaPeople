Jay-Z later explained that the album was made during one of the worst periods of his life when he was reeling from the death of his close friend, The Notorious B.I.G. The album was a personal revelation for Jay-Z as he told the stories of his difficult upbringing.{{cn|date=January 2020}} The album's glossy production stood as a contrast to his first release, and some dedicated fans felt he had "sold out." However, the album did feature some beats from producers who had worked with him on ''Reasonable Doubt'', namely DJ Premier and [[Ski (producer)|Ski]].

On October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York's [[Power 105.1]] annual concert, Powerhouse. The concert was entitled the "I Declare War" concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event on whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war. As he had previously "declared war" on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay-Z upon his rivals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1509668/09152005/jay_z.jhtml?headlines=true|title='I Declare War!'

Jay-Z later addressed the case in his 2010 book ''Decoded'':

{{cquote|One night I went to Q-Tip's solo album release party and at some point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I approached him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, "No the fuck this nigga did not..." I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted. [...] There was no reason to put my life on the line, and the lives of everyone who depends on me, because of a momentary loss of control. [...] I vowed to never allow myself to be in a situation like that again.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jay-Z|title=Decoded|url={{Google books|l2i0F2kSwwUC|Decoded|page=162|plainurl=yes}}|page=162|year=2010|publisher=[[Spiegel & Grau]]}}</ref>}}
