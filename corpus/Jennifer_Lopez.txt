'''Jennifer Lynn Lopez'''<ref name=Cartlidge-book /> (born July 24, 1969), also known by her nickname '''J.Lo''', is an American actress, singer, dancer, fashion designer, producer, and businesswoman. In 1991, Lopez began appearing as a [[List of In Living Color cast members#Fly Girls (house dance troupe)|Fly Girl]] dancer on ''[[In Living Color]]'', where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. For her first leading role in the 1997 [[Selena]] [[Selena (film)|biopic of the same name]], Lopez became the first Latin actress to earn over US$1 million for a film. She went on to star in ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' (1997) and ''[[Out of Sight]]'' (1998), later establishing herself as the highest-paid Latin actress in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Solid as a Rock|magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=July 2003|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yYEAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=August 25, 2017|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]}}</ref>

Lopez ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album ''[[On the 6]]'' (1999), which helped propel the [[Latin American music in the United States#1990s Latin Explosion|Latin pop movement]] in American music. With the simultaneous release of her second studio album ''[[J.Lo (album)|J.Lo]]'' and her romantic comedy ''[[The Wedding Planner]]'' in 2001, Lopez became the first woman to have a number-one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 remix album, ''[[J to tha L–O! The Remixes]]'', became the first in history to debut atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Later that year, she released her third studio album ''[[This Is Me... Then]]'', and starred in the US box office number-one ''[[Maid in Manhattan]]''.

After starring in ''[[Gigli]]'' (2003), a critical and commercial failure, Lopez subsequently starred in the successful romantic comedies ''[[Shall We Dance? (2004 film)|Shall We Dance?]]'' (2004) and ''[[Monster-in-Law]]'' (2005). Her fifth studio album, ''[[Como Ama una Mujer]]'' (2007), received the highest first-week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States. Following an unsuccessful period, she returned to prominence in 2011 with her appearance as a judge on ''[[American Idol]]'', and released her seventh studio album ''[[Love?]]''. From 2016 to 2018, she starred in the crime drama series ''[[Shades of Blue (TV series)|Shades of Blue]]'' and performed a residency show, [[Jennifer Lopez: All I Have]], at [[Planet Hollywood Las Vegas]]. Since 2017, Lopez has produced and served as a judge on ''[[World of Dance (TV series)|World of Dance]]''. In 2019, she garnered critical acclaim for her performance as a stripper in the crime drama ''[[Hustlers (film)|Hustlers]]''.

With a cumulative film gross of {{US$|3.1{{nbsp}}billion}} and estimated global sales of 70 million records, Lopez is regarded as the most influential Latin entertainer in the United States. In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked her as the most powerful celebrity in the world, as well as the 38th most powerful woman in the world.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goudreau|first1=Jenna|title=The World's Most Powerful Women: 16 New Faces|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/08/22/worlds-most-powerful-women-new-faces-jennifer-lopez-laurene-powell-jobs/|website=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=November 23, 2016|date=August 22, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' listed her among the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2018. Her most successful singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] include: "[[If You Had My Love]]", "[[I'm Real (Jennifer Lopez song)|I'm Real]]", "[[Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)|Ain't It Funny]]", "[[All I Have (song)|All I Have]]", and "[[On the Floor]]", the lattermost of which is one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles of all time]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Letkemann |first1=Jessica |title=Jennifer Lopez's Top 10 Biggest Billboard Hits |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/list/6091769/jennifer-lopez-top-10-songs-biggest-billboard-hits |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=June 29, 2018 |date=May 15, 2014}}</ref> For her contributions to the recording industry, Lopez has received a landmark star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], the [[Billboard Icon Award|''Billboard'' Icon Award]], and the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award]] among other honors.

When Lopez was born, the family was living in a small apartment in the [[Castle Hill, Bronx|Castle Hill]] neighborhood. A few years later, her parents had saved up enough money to be able to purchase a two-story house, which was considered a big deal for the relatively poor family.<ref name="Gallick2003">{{harvnb|Gallick|2003}}</ref> At the age of five, Lopez began taking singing and dancing lessons. She toured New York with her school when she was seven years old. Her parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home—singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay "out of trouble".<ref name="atriplethreat">{{cite web |url=http://www.evancarmichael.com/Famous-Entrepreneurs/619/The-Triple-Threat-Jennifer-Lopez-is-Born.html |title=The Triple Threat: Jennifer Lopez is Born |publisher=Evan Carmichael |accessdate=March 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226091637/http://www.evancarmichael.com/Famous-Entrepreneurs/619/The-Triple-Threat-Jennifer-Lopez-is-Born.html |archive-date=February 26, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Lopez spent her entire academic career in Catholic schools, finishing at [[Preston High School (New York City)|Preston High School]].<ref name=tca>Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2004</ref> In school, Lopez did gymnastics, ran track on a national level, and was a member of the school's softball team.<ref name=rantrack>{{cite book|last=Parish|first=James-Robert|title=Jennifer Lopez: Actor and Singer|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lh1Y2OK-VdsC&pg=PA129&dq=J-Lo:+The+Secret+Behind+Jennifer+Lopez's+Clib+to+the+Top#v=onepage&q=J-Lo%3A%20The%20Secret%20Behind%20Jennifer%20Lopez's%20Clib%20to%20the%20Top|isbn=978-0-8160-5832-7|date=November 30, 2005}}</ref> She excelled athletically rather than academically, competing in national track championships.<ref name=atriplethreat />

== Career ==

===1986–1996: Career beginnings and early roles===

While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a [[casting (performing arts)|film casting]] that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in ''[[My Little Girl]]'' (1986), a low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman.<ref name="Rovi My Little Girl">{{cite web|first=Eleanor |last=Mannikka |url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/my-little-girl-v34075|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121208172622/http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/my-little-girl-v34075|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 8, 2012|title=My Little Girl – Cast, Reviews, Summary, and Awards |work=[[AllRovi]] |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}</ref> Lopez acted as Myra, a young woman at a center for troubled girls. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez realized that she wanted to become a "famous movie star". To please her parents, though, she enrolled in [[Baruch College]], only to drop out after one semester. She told her parents about her dream of becoming a movie star, but they insisted that it was a "really stupid" idea and that "no Latinos did that". The differences in opinions led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in [[Manhattan]]. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of the musicals ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and ''[[Oklahoma!]]''. From there, she was hired for the chorus in a ''Golden Musicals of Broadway'', which toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus not to have a solo. She later got a job on the show ''Synchronicity'' in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer, and choreographer.<ref name="Gallick2003"/>

Lopez was selected as a backup dancer for the [[New Kids on the Block]] in 1991 and performed with them during their performance of "[[Games (New Kids on the Block song)|Games]]" at the [[American Music Awards of 1991|18th Annual American Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Perricon|first=Kathleen|title=Jennifer Lopez dances with New Kids on the Block in 1991 video clip|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-05-10/entertainment/29547058_1_nkotb-music-video-new-kids|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 22, 2012|date=May 10, 2011}}</ref> Shortly after, Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a [[List of In Living Color cast members#Fly Girls (house dance troupe)|Fly Girl]] dancer on the television program ''[[In Living Color]]''. She applied for the job after one of the cast members was unable to continue with the show. Out of 2,000 applicants, Lopez made it to the finals. She was the runner-up but eventually received the role when the winner was unable to accept the job. She moved to Los Angeles to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993, when she decided to pursue a full-time acting career. Prior to leaving the show, Lopez briefly worked as a backup dancer for American recording artist [[Janet Jackson]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Morales|first=Ed|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/30/entertainment/ca-42339|title=It's Not La Vida Loca to Her|accessdate=January 30, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 30, 1999}}</ref> Lopez was set to tour with Jackson on her [[Janet World Tour]] in late 1993 but backed out as she wanted to do her "own thing".<ref>{{cite news|title=Living Single|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA100|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |accessdate=July 6, 2012|page=100|date=May 2001}}</ref>
