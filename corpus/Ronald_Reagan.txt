'''Ronald Wilson Reagan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|eɪ|ɡ|ən}}; February 6, 1911{{spnd}}June 5, 2004) was an American politician<!-- NOT "statesman" per [[Talk:Ronald Reagan/Archive 18#RfC about whether Reagan is a statesman in the lead section]] --> who served as the 40th [[president of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989 and became a highly influential voice of modern [[conservatism]]. Prior to his presidency, he was a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor and [[Trade union|union]] leader before serving as the 33rd [[governor of California]] from 1967 to 1975.

Reagan was raised in a low-income family in small towns of northern [[Illinois]]. He graduated from [[Eureka College]] in 1932 and worked as a radio sports commentator. After moving to [[California]] in 1937, he found work as an actor and starred in a few major productions. As president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], Reagan worked to root out [[House Un-American Activities Committee|communist influence]]. In the 1950s, he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at [[General Electric]] factories. In 1964, his speech "[[A Time for Choosing]]" earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman. Building a network of supporters, Reagan was elected [[governor of California]] in [[1966 California gubernatorial election|1966]]. As governor, he raised taxes, turned a state budget deficit to a surplus, challenged the protesters at [[UC Berkeley]], and ordered in [[California National Guard|National Guard troops]] during [[People's Park (Berkeley)|a period of protest movements]].

In [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], Reagan won the Republican presidential nomination and defeated the [[incumbent]] president, [[Jimmy Carter]]. At {{ayd|1911|2|6|1981|1|20}} of age at the time of his [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|first inauguration]], Reagan was the oldest person to assume the U.S. presidency, a distinction he held until 2017, when [[Donald Trump]] was [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inaugurated]] at age {{ayd|1946|6|14|2017|1|20}}. Reagan faced former vice president [[Walter Mondale]] when he ran for re-election in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] and defeated him, winning the most [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] of any U.S. president, 525, or 97.6% of the 538 votes in the Electoral College. It was the [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|second-most lopsided presidential election]] in modern U.S. history after [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] victory over [[Alf Landon|Alfred M. Landon]], in which he won 98.5%, or 523, of the (then-total) 531 electoral votes.<ref name="murse1">{{cite web| title=The Most Lopsided Presidential Elections in U.S. History: How a Landslide is Measured| last=Murse| first=Tom| date=January 28, 2019| url=https://www.thoughtco.com/landslide-presidential-elections-by-electoral-votes-3367489| publisher=ThoughtCo| accessdate=March 9, 2019}}</ref>

Immediately on taking office as president, Reagan began implementing sweeping new political and economic initiatives that were highly popular among conservatives but denounced by liberals.  Reagan won over enough conservative Democrats to pass his program through Congress.  Economic conditions had deteriorated under Carter, with slow growth and high inflation. Reagan promised that  his [[supply-side economics|supply-side economic]] policies, dubbed "[[Reaganomics]]", would turn around the economy with lower tax rates, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending.  However conditions remained harsh until they finally turned as promised in time for his reelection in 1984. Over his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4% and an average [[real GDP]] annual growth of 3.6%. Reagan enacted cuts in domestic discretionary spending, cut taxes, and increased military spending, which contributed to increased federal debt overall. In his first term, he survived an [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|assassination attempt]], spurred the [[War on Drugs]], and fought public sector labor unions.  

In foreign affairs he denounced Communism and [[United States invasion of Grenada|invaded the island country of Grenada after far-left elements took control]]. It represented a rollback of Communism that astonished the world.  With the economy booming again, foreign affair crises dominated his second term. Major concerns were the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|bombing of Libya]], the [[Iran–Iraq War]], the [[Iran–Contra affair]], and the renewed [[Cold War]]. In June 1987, four years after he publicly described the Soviet Union as an "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]", Reagan challenged Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to "[[tear down this wall!]]", during a speech at the Berlin Wall. He transitioned Cold War policy from [[détente]] to [[rollback]] by escalating an [[arms race]] with the USSR. He then engaged in talks with Gorbachev that culminated in the [[INF Treaty]], which shrank both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan began his presidency during the decline of the Soviet Union. The Cold War ended in October 1989 and [[Soviet Union collapse| Soviet communism suddenly collapsed in 1991]].

When Reagan left office in January 1989, he held an approval rating of 68%, matching those of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and later [[Bill Clinton]], as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.<ref name="cbsnews1">{{cite web|title = A Look Back At The Polls|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-look-back-at-the-polls/|publisher = CBS News|accessdate = May 15, 2015}}</ref> Although he had planned an active post-presidency, Reagan disclosed in November 1994 that he had been diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] earlier that year. Afterward, his informal public appearances became more infrequent as the disease progressed. He [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|died at home]] on June 5, 2004. His tenure constituted a [[Political realignment|realignment]] toward conservative policies in the United States, and he is an icon among conservatives. Evaluations of his presidency among historians and the general public place him [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|among the upper tier of American presidents]].

==Early life==
[[File:Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home (8030104930).jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Reagan's boyhood home in [[Dixon, Illinois]]]]

Ronald Wilson Reagan was born on February 6, 1911, in an apartment on the [[Birthplace of Ronald Reagan|second floor of a commercial building]] in [[Tampico, Illinois]]. He was the younger son of [[Nelle Wilson Reagan|Nelle Clyde]] ({{nee|Wilson}}; 1883–1962) and [[Jack Reagan]] (1883–1941).<ref name=nrhp /> Jack was a salesman and storyteller whose grandparents were [[Irish Catholic]] emigrants from [[County Tipperary]],<ref>[[Terry Golway]], ''Ronald Reagan's America'' (2008) p. 1.</ref> while Nelle was of English, Irish and Scottish descent.<ref name="pk 4">Kengor, p. 4.</ref> Reagan's older brother, [[Neil Reagan]] (1908–1996), became an advertising executive.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Neil Reagan, 88, Ad Executive And Jovial Brother of President|author=Lynette Holloway|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/13/us/neil-reagan-88-ad-executive-and-jovial-brother-of-president.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 13, 1996|accessdate=March 22, 2009}}</ref>

===Religion===
Ronald Reagan wrote that his mother "always expected to find the best in people and often did."<ref name="am 22">Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 22.</ref> She attended the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] church regularly and was active, and very influential, within it; she frequently led Sunday school services and gave the Bible readings to the congregation during the services. A firm believer in the power of [[prayer]], she led prayer meetings at church and was in charge of mid-week prayers when the pastor was out of town.<ref>Kengor, p. 12.</ref> She was also an adherent of the [[Social Gospel]] movement.<ref name=jacobin>{{cite web |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/03/reagan-american-journey-review-spitz-biography |title=The Paranoid, Reactionary Dreams of Ronald Reagan |last=Rubin |first=Lyle Jeremy |date=March 16, 2019 |website=[[Jacobin (magazine)]]|access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref> Her strong commitment to the church is what induced her son Ronald to become a Protestant Christian rather than a Roman Catholic like his Irish father.<ref name="pk 4"/> He also stated that she strongly influenced his own beliefs: "I know that she planted that faith very deeply in me."<ref>Kengor, p. 48.</ref> Reagan identified himself as a born-again Christian.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1980/07/25/reagan-carter-anderson-three-born-again-christians-who-differ-on-meaning/55792b50-3e7b-4539-94f8-a861f24f51b7/|title=Reagan, Carter, Anderson: Three 'Born Again' Christians Who Differ on Meaning|date=July 25, 1980|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>   In Dixon, Reagan was strongly influenced by his pastor Beh Hill Cleaver, an erudite scholar. Cleaver was the father of Reagan's fiancé. Reagan saw him a second father. Stephen Vaughn says:
: At many points the positions taken by the First Christian Church of Reagan's youth coincided with the words, if not the beliefs of the latter-day Reagan. These positions included faith in Providence, association of America's mission with God's will, belief in progress, trust in the work ethic and admiration for those who achieved wealth, an uncomfortableness with literature and art that questioned the family or challenged notions of proper sexual behavior, presumption that poverty is an individual problem best left to charity rather than the state, sensitivity to problems involving alcohol and drugs, and reticence to use government to protect civil rights for minorities. <ref>Stephen Vaughn, "The moral inheritance of a president: Reagan and the Dixon Disciples of Christ." ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' (1995): 109-127 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27551378 online].</ref>

According to [[Paul Kengor]], Reagan had a particularly strong faith in the goodness of people; this faith stemmed from the optimistic faith of his mother<ref name="pk 16">Kengor, p. 16.</ref> and the [[Disciples of Christ]] faith,<ref name="pk 16" /> into which he was baptized in 1922.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Lewis|editor-first1=Warren|editor-last2=Rollmann|editor-first2=Hans|title=Restoring the First-century Church in the Twenty-first Century|publisher=Wipf and Stock|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59752-416-2|pages=181–192}}</ref> For that period, which was long before the [[civil rights movement]], Reagan's opposition to [[racial discrimination]] was unusual. He recalled the time when his college football team was staying at a local hotel which would not allow two black teammates to stay there, and he invited them to his parents' home {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} away in Dixon. His mother invited them to stay overnight and have breakfast the next morning.<ref name="Jeremy Mayer, Reagan and two African-American teammates">''Deconstructing Reagan: Conservative Mythology and America's Fortieth President'', Kyle Longley, Jeremy D.

==Entertainment career==

===Radio and film===
After graduating from Eureka in 1932, Reagan took jobs in Iowa as a radio announcer at several stations. He moved to [[WHO (AM)|WHO]] radio in [[Des Moines]] as an announcer for [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball games. His specialty was creating play-by-play accounts of games using only basic descriptions that the station received by wire as the games were in progress.<ref>Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&nbsp;24–31.</ref>

[[File:Ronald Reagan in The Bad Man (1941).png|thumb|''[[The Bad Man (1941 film)|The Bad Man]]'' (1941)]]

While traveling with the Cubs in California in 1937, Reagan took a screen test that led to a seven-year contract with [[Warner Bros.]] studios.<ref>Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&nbsp;35–41.</ref> He spent the first few years of his Hollywood career in the "[[B film]]" unit, where, Reagan joked, the producers "didn't want them good; they wanted them Thursday".<ref name="agpi" />

He earned his first screen credit with a starring role in the 1937 movie ''[[Love Is on the Air]]'', and by the end of 1939, he had already appeared in 19 films,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp|title=Ronald Reagan > Hollywood Years|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation|accessdate=March 28, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312120428/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp|archivedate=March 12, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> including ''[[Dark Victory]]'' with [[Bette Davis]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Before the film ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' with [[Errol Flynn]] in 1940, he played the role of [[George Gipp]] in the film ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]''; from it, he acquired the lifelong nickname "the Gipper."<ref name="Cannon15">Cannon & Beschloss (2001), p. 15.</ref> In 1941, exhibitors voted him the fifth most popular star from the younger generation in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8208562|title=Cupid's Influence on the Film Box-office.|newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848–1956)]]|location=Melbourne, Vic.|date=October 4, 1941|accessdate=April 24, 2012|page=7 Supplement: The Argus Week–end Magazine|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

''Kings Row'' made Reagan a star—Warner immediately tripled his salary to $3,000 a week. Early in 1942, he was ordered to military active duty in San Francisco and never became a true film star.<ref name="Friedrich">{{Cite book|last =Friedrich|first =Otto|title =City of nets: a portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s|publisher=University of California Press (reprint)|year =1997|pages =86–89,105–106|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=1Y9uZw7YNK8C |isbn =978-0-520-20949-7}}</ref> After his wartime military service he co-starred in such films as ''[[The Voice of the Turtle (film)|The Voice of the Turtle]]'', ''[[John Loves Mary]]'', ''[[The Hasty Heart]]'', ''[[Bedtime for Bonzo]]'', ''[[Cattle Queen of Montana]]'', ''[[Tennessee's Partner]]'', ''[[Hellcats of the Navy]]'' (the only film in which he appears with Nancy Reagan), and the 1964 remake ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (his final film).

===Military service===
[[File:Reagan FMPU.jpg|thumb|left|Capt. Ronald Reagan at [[First Motion Picture Unit#Life at Fort Roach|Fort Roach]]]]

===Screen Actors Guild presidency===

In 1946, Reagan served on the national board of directors for the [[Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions]] (ICCASP) and had been a member of its Hollywood chapter (HICCASP).

===HUAC's Hollywood hearings===
In October 1947 during HUAC's Hollywood hearings, Reagan (whose name also appears as "Regan" in the text of the hearings printed by the [[United States Government Printing Office|US GPO]]) testified as president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]]:<ref name=HollywoodHearings>

<blockquote>There has been a small group within the Screen Actors Guild which has consistently opposed the policy of the guild board and officers of the guild... suspected of more or less following the tactics that we associate with the Communist Party... At times they have attempted to be a disruptive influence... I have heard different discussions and some of them tagged as Communists... I found myself misled into being a sponsor on another occasion for a function that was held under the auspices of the [[Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee]].<ref name=HollywoodHearings/></blockquote>

Regarding a "jurisdictional strike" going on for seven months at that time, Reagan testified:
<blockquote>The first time that this word "Communist" was ever injected into any of the meetings concerning the strike was at a meeting in Chicago with Mr. William Hutchinson, president of the [[United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners]], who were on strike at the time. He asked the Screen Actors Guild to submit terms to Mr. Walsh, for Walsh to give in the settling of this strike, and he told us to tell Mr. Walsh that if he would give in on these terms he in turn would run this Sorrell and the other Commies out—I am quoting him—and break it up.<ref name=HollywoodHearings/></blockquote>  However, Reagan also opposed measures soon to manifest in the [[Mundt-Nixon Bill]] in May 1948 by opining:<blockquote> As a citizen I would hesitate, or not like, to see any political party outlawed on the basis of its political ideology... I detest, I abhor their philosophy, but I detest more than that their tactics, which are those of the fifth column, and are dishonest, but at the same time I never as a citizen want to see our country become urged, by either fear or resentment of this group, that we ever compromise with any of our democratic principles through that fear or resentment.<ref name=HollywoodHearings/></blockquote>

Further, when asked whether he was aware of Communist efforts within the [[Screen Writers Guild]], Reagan would not play along, saying, "Sir, like the other gentlemen, I must say that that is hearsay."<ref name=HollywoodHearings/>

==Early political career==
[[File:Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan aboard a boat in California 1964.jpg|thumb|Nancy and Ronald Reagan aboard a boat in California, 1964]]

Reagan began as a Hollywood [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was "a true hero" to him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edward M.

Johns, ed., ''A Companion to Ronald Reagan'' (2015) pp.&nbsp;22–39.</ref>

In his early political career, he joined numerous political committees with a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] orientation, such as the [[American Veterans Committee (1943–2008)|American Veterans Committee]]. He fought against Republican-sponsored right-to-work legislation and supported [[Helen Gahagan Douglas]] in 1950 when she [[1950 United States Senate election in California|was defeated for the Senate]] by [[Richard Nixon]]. It was his realization that [[Communism|Communists]] were a powerful backstage influence in those groups that led him to rally his friends against them.<ref>{{cite book|author=J.

At rallies, Reagan frequently spoke with a strong ideological dimension. In December 1945, he was stopped from leading an anti-nuclear rally in Hollywood by pressure from the [[Warner Bros.]] studio. He would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his presidency when he specifically stated his opposition to [[mutual assured destruction]]. Reagan also built on previous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/president-reagans-legacy-and-us-nuclear-weapons-policy |title=President Reagan's Legacy and U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy |publisher=Heritage.org |date=July 20, 2006 |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref> In the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 presidential election]], Reagan strongly supported [[Harry S.

Eisenhower]] (1952 and 1956) and Richard Nixon (1960).<ref>Pemberton (1998) pp.&nbsp;29–31.</ref>

Reagan was hired by [[General Electric]] (GE) in 1954 to host the ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', a weekly TV drama series. He also traveled across the country to give motivational speeches to over 200,000 GE employees. His many speeches—which he wrote himself—were [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] but carried a conservative, pro-business message; he was influenced by [[Lemuel Boulware]], a senior GE executive. Boulware, known for his tough stance against unions and his innovative strategies to win over workers, championed the core tenets of modern American conservatism: [[free markets]], [[anti-communism|anticommunism]], lower taxes, and [[limited government]].<ref>Thomas W. Evans, ''The Education of Ronald Reagan: The General Electric Years and the Untold Story of His Conversion to Conservatism'' (2008).</ref> Eager for a larger stage, but not allowed to enter politics by GE, he quit and formally registered as a Republican.<ref>Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) p. 128.</ref> He often said, "I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me."<ref>Hayward, p. 635.</ref>

When the legislation that would become [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] was introduced in 1961, he created a recording for the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) warning that such legislation would mean the end of freedom in America. Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, "we will awake to find that we have [[socialism]]. And if you don't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free."<ref>{{YouTube|id=AYrlDlrLDSQ|title=Ronald Reagan speaks out on Socialized Medicine&nbsp;– Audio|link=no}}</ref><ref>Richard Rapaport, June 21, 2009, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/06/18/INME187IB0.DTL How AMA 'Coffeecup' gave Reagan a boost].

Reagan gained national attention in his speeches for conservative presidential contender [[Barry Goldwater]] in 1964.<ref>Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&nbsp;1–6</ref> Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government.

This "A Time for Choosing" speech was not enough to turn around the faltering Goldwater campaign, but it was the crucial event that established Reagan's national political visibility.

Reagan was involved in several high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era, including his public criticism of university administrators for tolerating student demonstrations at the Berkeley campus. On May 15, 1969, during the [[People's Park (Berkeley)#May 15, 1969: "Bloody Thursday"|People's Park protests]] at the university's campus (the original purpose of which was to discuss the [[Arab–Israeli conflict#1967–73|Arab–Israeli conflict]]), Reagan sent the [[California Highway Patrol]] and other officers to quell the protests.

Early in 1967, the national debate on abortion was starting to gain traction. In the early stages of the debate, Democratic California state senator [[Anthony Beilenson]] introduced the Therapeutic Abortion Act in an effort to reduce the number of "back-room abortions" performed in California.<ref name="Cannon50" /> The state legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he reluctantly signed it on June 14, 1967.<ref name="Cannon51">Cannon & Beschloss (2001), p. 51</ref> About two million abortions would be performed as a result, mostly because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother.<ref name="Cannon51" /> Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill and later stated that had he been more experienced as governor, he would not have signed it. After he recognized what he called the "consequences" of the bill, he announced that he was [[anti-abortion]].<ref name="Cannon51" /> He maintained that position later in his political career, writing extensively about abortion.<ref>Reagan, Ronald.

In 1967, Reagan signed the [[Mulford Act]], which repealed a law allowing the [[Open carry in the United States|public carrying]] of loaded firearms (becoming [[California Penal Code]] 12031 and 171(c)). The bill, which was named after Republican assemblyman [[Don Mulford]], garnered national attention after the [[Black Panthers]] marched bearing arms upon the [[California State Capitol]] to protest it.<ref name="huey newton">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/actions/actions_capitolmarch.html |title=From "A Huey P.

Unruh]]. He chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle. One of Reagan's greatest frustrations in office was the controversy of [[capital punishment]], which he strongly supported.<ref name="Rest of Me" /> His efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area were thwarted when the [[Supreme Court of California]] issued its ''[[People v. Anderson]]'' decision, which invalidated all death sentences issued in California before 1972, though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment. The only execution during Reagan's governorship was on April 12, 1967, when [[Aaron Mitchell (murderer)|Aaron Mitchell]]'s sentence was carried out by the state in [[San Quentin]]'s gas chamber.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Seneker, Carl J|title=Governor Reagan and Executive Clemency|journal=California Law Review|volume=55|issue=2|pages=412–418|date=May 1967|doi=10.2307/3479351|jstor=3479351}}</ref>

Reagan's terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president. By campaigning on a platform of sending "the welfare bums back to work," he spoke out against the idea of the [[welfare state]]. He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy, including that of undue federal taxation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/7092/reagan_economic_legacy.html|title=The Reagan Economic Legacy|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=June 9, 2004|author=Kubarych, Roger M|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731075753/http://www.cfr.org/publication/7092/reagan_economic_legacy.html|archivedate=July 31, 2008}}</ref>

However, as [[1976 Republican National Convention|the GOP convention]] neared, Ford appeared close to victory.

Nonetheless, Ford prevailed with 1,187 delegates to Reagan's 1,070.<ref name="1976 Results" />

Reagan's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union.

During Reagan's presidency, a program was initiated within the [[United States Intelligence Community]] to ensure America's economic strength. The program, [[Project Socrates]], developed and demonstrated the means required for the United States to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantage—automated innovation. To ensure that the United States acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation, Reagan, during his second term, had an executive order drafted to create a new federal agency to implement the Project Socrates results on a nationwide basis. However, Reagan's term came to an end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed, and the incoming Bush administration, labeling Project Socrates as "industrial policy," had it terminated.<ref>{{cite news|first =Gene|last =Koprowski|title =Tech Intelligence Revival?

Reagan accepted the Republican nomination in the [[1984 Republican National Convention|Republican convention]] in Dallas, Texas.

Reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the [[White House]]. To date, at 73 years of age, he is the oldest person to take the presidential oath of office. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the [[Capitol rotunda]] the following day. January 21 was one of the [[Winter 1985 cold wave|coldest days on record]] in Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol. In the weeks that followed, he shook up his staff somewhat, moving [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[James Baker]] to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary [[Donald Regan]], a former [[Merrill Lynch]] officer, Chief of Staff.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/05/us/briefing-186924.html|title=Phil Gailey and Warren Weaver Jr., "Briefing"|work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 27, 2011|date=June 5, 1982}}</ref>

====War on drugs====
{{Main|War on drugs}}

In response to concerns about the increasing [[crack epidemic]], Reagan began the war on drugs campaign in 1982, a policy led by the federal government to reduce the illegal drug trade. Though Nixon had previously declared war on drugs, Reagan advocated more aggressive policies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Alexander|first=Michelle|title=The New Jim Crow|year=2010|publisher= The New Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59558-103-7|page=5|title-link=The New Jim Crow}}</ref> He said that "drugs were menacing our society" and promised to fight for drug-free schools and workplaces, expanded drug treatment, stronger law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts, and greater public awareness.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lamar |first=Jacob V., Jr|title=Rolling Out the Big Guns|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=September 22, 1986|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962371-1,00.html|accessdate=August 20, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/03justice/crime09.htm|title=The Drug War as Race War|accessdate=April 11, 2007|author=Randall, Vernellia R.|date=April 18, 2006|publisher=The University of Dayton School of Law}}</ref>

In 1986, Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that budgeted $1.7&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|1.7|1986|r=1}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation/year|US}}) to fund the war on drugs and specified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses.<ref name="PBS Frontline">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/cron/|title=Thirty Years of America's Drug War|accessdate=April 4, 2007}}</ref> The bill was criticized for promoting significant [[Race and the war on drugs|racial disparities in the prison population]],<ref name="PBS Frontline" /> and critics also charged that the policies did little to reduce the availability of drugs on the street while resulting in a tremendous financial burden for America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/341/reagan.shtml|publisher=Drug Reform Coordination Network|title=The Reagan-Era Drug War Legacy|date=June 11, 2004|accessdate=April 4, 2007}}</ref> Defenders of the effort point to success in reducing rates of adolescent drug use which they attribute to the Reagan administrations policies:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofacts/HSYouthtrends.html|title=NIDA InfoFacts: High School and Youth Trends|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIH|accessdate=April 4, 2007}}</ref> marijuana use among high-school seniors declined from 33 percent in 1980 to 12 percent in 1991.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/kleber.html|title=Interview: Dr. Herbert Kleber|accessdate=June 12, 2007|publisher=PBS|quote=The politics of the Reagan years and the Bush years probably made it somewhat harder to get treatment expanded, but at the same time, it probably had a good effect in terms of decreasing initiation and use.

====Response to AIDS epidemic====
According to AIDS activist organizations such as [[ACT UP]] and scholars such as [[Don Francis]] and Peter S.

====Addressing apartheid====
From the late 1960s onward, the American public grew increasingly vocal in its opposition to the [[apartheid]] policy of the white-[[Dominant minority|minority]] government of [[South Africa]], and in its insistence that the U.S. impose economic and diplomatic sanctions on South Africa.<ref name=AT2008SApolicy>{{cite book |last1=Thomson |first1=Alex |title=U.S. Foreign Policy Towards Apartheid South Africa 1948-1994: Conflict of Interests |date=2008 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-1-4039-7227-9 |pages=106–123}}</ref> The strength of the anti-apartheid opposition surged during Reagan's first term in office as its component [[disinvestment from South Africa]] movement, which had been in existence for quite some years, gained critical mass following in the United States, particularly on college campuses and among [[Mainline Protestant|mainline Protestant denominations]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Divestment Was Just One Weapon in Battle Against Apartheid| last=Counte| first=Cecelie| date=January 27, 2013| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/01/27/is-divestment-an-effective-means-of-protest/divestment-was-just-one-weapon-in-battle-against-apartheid| website=nytimes.com| publisher=The New York Times Company| accessdate=August 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last=Berger| first=Joseph| title=Protestants Seek More Divestment| date=June 10, 1986| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/10/us/protestants-seek-more-divestment.html| work=The New York Times| location=New York, New York|accessdate=August 13, 2019| via=The Times's print archive}}</ref> President Reagan was opposed to divestiture because, as he wrote in a letter to [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], it "would hurt the very people we are trying to help and would leave us no contact within South Africa to try and bring influence to bear on the government". He also noted the fact that the "American-owned industries there employ more than 80,000 blacks" and that their employment practices were "very different from the normal South African customs".<ref>{{cite book| editor1-last=Skinner| editor1-first=Kiron K.| editor2-last=Anderson| editor2-first=Annelise| editor3-last=Anderson| editor3-first= Martin| title=Reagan: A Life In Letters| year=2004| publisher=Free Press| location=New York, New York| isbn=978-0743219679| pages=520–521}}</ref>

As an alternative strategy for opposing apartheid, the Reagan Administration developed a policy of [[constructive engagement]] with the South African government as a means of encouraging it to move away from apartheid gradually. It was part of a larger initiative designed to foster peaceful economic development and political change throughout [[southern Africa]].<ref name=AT2008SApolicy/> This policy, however, engendered much public criticism and renewed calls for the imposition of stringent sanctions.<ref name=UngerVale>{{cite journal| last1=Ungar| first1=Sanford J.| last2=Vale| first2=Peter| title=South Africa: Why Constructive Engagement Failed | journal=Foreign Affairs| date=Winter 1985–86| volume=64| issue=2| url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/south-africa/1985-12-01/south-africa-why-constructive-engagement-failed| pages=234–258| doi=10.2307/20042571| jstor=20042571}}</ref> In response, Reagan announced the imposition of new sanctions on the South African government, including an [[arms embargo]] in late 1985.<ref>{{cite magazine| last=Smith| first=William E.| title=South Africa Reagan's Abrupt Reversal| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959843,00.html| date=September 16, 1985| magazine=TIME | volume=126| issue=11 |accessdate=August 13, 2019}}</ref> These sanctions were, however, seen as weak by anti-apartheid activists, and as insufficient by the president's opponents in Congress.<ref name=UngerVale/> In August 1986, Congress approved the [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act]], which included tougher sanctions. Reagan vetoed the act, but the veto was overridden by Congress. Afterward, Reagan reiterated that his administration and "all America" opposed apartheid, and said, "the debate{{nbsp}}... was not whether or not to oppose apartheid but, instead, how best to oppose it and how best to bring freedom to that troubled country." Several European countries as well as Japan soon followed the U.S. lead and imposed their sanctions on South Africa.<ref>{{cite web| last=Glass| first=Andrew| title=House overrides Reagan apartheid veto, Sept. 29, 1986| date=September 27, 2017| url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/29/house-overrides-reagan-apartheid-veto-sept-29-1986-243169| publisher=Politico| accessdate=August 13, 2019}}</ref>

Relations between Libya and the United States under President Reagan were continually contentious, beginning with the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)|Gulf of Sidra incident]] in 1981; by 1982, Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] was considered by the CIA to be, along with USSR leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]], part of a group known as the "unholy trinity" and was also labeled as "our international public enemy number one" by a CIA official.<ref name=iokp;>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925697,00.htm | title= Libya: Fury in the Isolation Ward|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 23, 1982|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}</ref> These tensions were later revived in early April 1986, when [[West Berlin discotheque bombing|a bomb exploded in a Berlin discothèque]], resulting in the injury of 63 American military personnel and death of one serviceman.

By a vote of 79 in favor to 28 against with 33 abstentions, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted resolution 41/38 which "condemns the military attack perpetrated against the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on April 15, 1986, which constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/41/a41r038.htm |title=A/RES/41/38 November 20, 1986 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref>

====Immigration====
Reagan signed the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act]] in 1986. The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit [[illegal immigrants]], required employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and granted [[amnesty]] to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the United States before January 1, 1982, and had lived in the country continuously. Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished [[Statue of Liberty]], Reagan said, "The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society. Very soon, many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and, ultimately, if they choose, they may become Americans."<ref name="immigration">Reagan, Ronald.

Meanwhile, Reagan escalated the rhetoric. In his famous 1983 speech to religious fundamentalists, he outlined his strategy for victory. First, he labeled the Soviet system an "[[Evil Empire speech|Evil Empire]]" and a failure—its demise would be a godsend for the world. Second, Reagan explained his strategy was an arms buildup that would leave the Soviets far behind, with no choice but to negotiate arms reduction. Finally, displaying his characteristic optimism, he praised liberal democracy and promised that such a system eventually would triumph over Soviet communism.<ref>Robert C. Rowland and John M.

Reagan appreciated the revolutionary change in the direction of the Soviet policy with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and shifted to diplomacy, intending to encourage the Soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements.<ref name="Knopf" /> He and Gorbachev held [[List of Soviet Union–United States summits#Cold War (1985–1991)|four summit conferences]] between 1985 and 1988: the [[Geneva Summit (1985)|first]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], the [[Reykjavík Summit|second]] in [[Reykjavík, Iceland]], the third in Washington, D.C., and the fourth in Moscow.<ref>Mark Atwood Lawrence, "The Era of Epic Summitry."

To the astonishment of the world, and the chagrin of Reagan's most conservative supporters, they agreed to abolish all nuclear weapons. Gorbachev then asked the end of SDI. Reagan said no, claiming that it was defensive only, and that he would share the secrets with the Soviets.

When Reagan visited Moscow for the fourth summit in 1988, he was viewed as a celebrity by the Soviets. A journalist asked the president if he still considered the Soviet Union the evil empire.

On July 13, 1985, Reagan underwent surgery at [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] to remove cancerous [[Polyp (medicine)|polyps]] from his [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]].

===Judiciary===
{{Main|Ronald Reagan Supreme Court candidates|List of federal judges appointed by Ronald Reagan}}

During the 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan pledged that he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice if given the opportunity.<ref>Reagan (1990), p. 280.</ref> That opportunity came during his first year in office when [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Potter Stewart]] retired; Reagan selected [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], who was [[Appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States|confirmed]] unanimously by the Senate. In his second term, Reagan had three opportunities to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. When [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren E. Burger]] retired in September 1986, Reagan nominated [[incumbent]] Associate Justice [[William Rehnquist]] to succeed Burger as Chief Justice (the appointment of an incumbent associate justice as chief justice is subject to a separate confirmation process). Then, following Rehnquist's confirmation, the president named [[Antonin Scalia]] to fill the consequent associate justice vacancy.<ref>{{cite book| last=Davis| first=Sue| title=Justice Rehnquist and the Constitution| chapter=Chapter 10.

Powell Jr.]] announced his intention to retire. Reagan initially chose Conservative jurist [[Robert Bork]] to succeed Powell. [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination|Bork's nomination]] was strongly opposed by civil and women's rights groups, and by Senate Democrats.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Washington; Kennedy And Bork|accessdate=April 28, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/opinion/washington-kennedy-and-bork.html|author=Reston, James|date=July 5, 1987|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> That October, after a contentious Senate debate, the nomination was rejected by a [[Recorded vote|roll call vote]] of 42–58.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Greenhouse, Linda|title=Bork's Nomination Is Rejected, 58–42; Reagan 'Saddened'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/us/bork-s-nomination-is-rejected-58-42-reagan-saddened.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 24, 1987|accessdate=November 12, 2007}}</ref> Soon afterward, Reagan announced his intention to nominate [[Douglas H.

Along with his four Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to the [[United States courts of appeals]], and 290 judges to the [[United States district court]]s. Early in his presidency, Reagan appointed [[Clarence M. Pendleton Jr.]], of [[San Diego]] as the first African American to chair the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]]. Pendleton tried to steer the commission into a conservative direction in line with Reagan's views on social and civil rights policy during his tenure from 1981 until his sudden death in 1988. Pendleton soon aroused the ire of many civil rights advocates and feminists when he ridiculed the [[Equal pay for equal work|comparable worth]] proposal as being "[[Looney Tunes]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/nkaa/record.php?note_id=1144|title=Pendleton, Clarence M.

Opinions of Reagan's legacy among the country's leading policymakers and journalists differ as well. [[Edwin Feulner]], president of [[The Heritage Foundation]], said that Reagan "helped create a safer, freer world" and said of his economic policies: "He took an America suffering from 'malaise'{{nbsp}}... and made its citizens believe again in their destiny."<ref>{{cite web|last=Feulner|first=Edwin J.|url=http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed060904b.cfm|title=The Legacy of Ronald Reagan|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=June 9, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011205706/http://heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed060904b.cfm|archivedate=October 11, 2007}}</ref> However, [[Mark Weisbrot]], co-Director of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]], contended that Reagan's "economic policies were mostly a failure"<ref>{{cite web|last=Weisbrot|first=Mark|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0607-09.htm|title=Ronald Reagan's Legacy|publisher=Common Dreams News Center|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2007}}</ref> while [[Howard Kurtz]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' opined that Reagan was "a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kurtz|first=Howard|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21671-2004Jun7.html|title=Reagan: The Retake|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=August 25, 2005}}</ref>

Despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy, many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan has been the most influential president since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics through his effective communication and pragmatic compromising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/president/reagan/essays/biography/8|title=American President|accessdate=October 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011080053/http://millercenter.org/president/reagan/essays/biography/8|archivedate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Since he left office, historians have reached a consensus,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=David|title=Ronald Reagan and the 1980s: Perceptions, Policies, Legacies.

Reagan's major achievement was the end of the Cold War as he left office. Furthermore, the USSR and Soviet-sponsored Communist movements worldwide were falling apart—and collapsed completely three years after he left office. The U.S. thus became the only superpower. His admirers say he won the Cold War.<ref>For example, Peter Schweizer, ''Reagan's War: The Epic Story of his Forty Year Struggle and Final Triumph Over Communism'' (2002).</ref> After 40 years of high tension, the USSR pulled back in the last years of Reagan's second term. In 1989, the Kremlin lost control of all its East European satellites. In 1991, Communism was overthrown in the USSR, and on December 26, 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. The resulting states were no threat to the United States. Reagan's exact role is debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard-line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism—together with his summits with General Secretary Gorbachev—played a significant part in ending the Cold War.<ref name="American Dreamer">{{Cite news|title=American Dreamer |last1=Meacham|first1=John |last2=Murr|first2=Andrew |last3=Clift|first3=Eleanor |last4=Lipper|first4=Tamara |last5=Breslau|first5=Karen |last6=Ordonez|first6=Jennifer|date=June 14, 2004|work=Newsweek|accessdate=June 3, 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/54017?tid=relatedcl}}</ref><ref name="Knopf">{{Cite journal|last=Knopf, PhD|first=Jeffery W.|date=August 2004|title=Did Reagan Win the Cold War?|journal=Strategic Insights|volume=III|issue=8|url=https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=444565|accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>
