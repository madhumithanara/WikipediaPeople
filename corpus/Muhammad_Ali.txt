'''Muhammad Ali''' ({{IPAc-en|ɑː|ˈ|l|iː}};<ref>{{cite LPD|3|Ali |quote=the former boxer Muhammad Ali pronounces {{IPA|ɑːˈliː}}}}</ref> born '''Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.''';<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2016/07/11/muhammad-ali-name-change-cassius-clay/86956544/ |title=Why Muhammad Ali never legally changed name from Cassius Clay|publisher=USA Today|date=July 11, 2016|last=Peter|first=Josh|access-date=July 12, 2016}}</ref> January 17, 1942 – June 3, 2016) was an American professional boxer, activist, and philanthropist. Nicknamed "The Greatest", he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated figures of the 20th century and as one of the greatest boxers of all time.

Ali was born and raised in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the [[light heavyweight]] division at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], and turned professional later that year. He converted to [[Islam]] and became a [[Muslims|Muslim]] after 1961, and eventually took the name Muhammad Ali. He won the world [[heavyweight]] championship from [[Sonny Liston]] in [[Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston|a major upset]] at age 22 in 1964. In 1966, Ali refused to be drafted into the military, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name="HauserThomas" /><ref name="Roberts">{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Randy |title=Winning is the Only Thing: Sports in America Since 1945 |date=1991 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |pages=171–172}}</ref> He was arrested, found guilty of draft evasion, and stripped of his boxing titles. He appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which [[Clay v. United States|overturned his conviction in 1971]], but he had not fought for nearly four years and lost a period of peak performance as an athlete.

===Early career===
[[File:1961 Cassius Clay vs. Donnie Fleeman On-Site Poster.jpg|thumb|upright|On-site poster for Cassius Clay's fifth professional bout]]
Clay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over [[Tunney Hunsaker]]. From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19–0 with 15 wins by knockout. He defeated boxers including Tony Esperti, [[Jim Robinson (boxer)|Jim Robinson]], Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, [[LaMar Clark]], [[Doug Jones (boxer)|Doug Jones]] and [[Henry Cooper]]. Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer [[Archie Moore]] in a 1962 match.<ref>{{cite news |last=Calkins |first=Matt |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2014/nov/17/archie-moore-the52-boxing-heavyweight/ |title=Archie Moore was the KO king |work=[[U-T San Diego]] |date=November 17, 2014 |accessdate=June 15, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mgDK3q6GWI8C |title=Ali in Action: The Man, the Moves, the Mouth |first=Les |last=Krantz |date=January 1, 2008 |publisher=Globe Pequot |accessdate=June 15, 2016 |via=Google Books |isbn=9781599213026}}</ref>

These early fights were not without trials. Clay was knocked down by both [[Sonny Banks]] and Cooper. In the Cooper fight, Clay was floored by a left [[Hook (boxing)|hook]] at the end of round four and was saved by the bell, going on to win in the predicted 5th round due to Cooper's severely cut eye. The fight with Doug Jones on March 13, 1963 was Clay's toughest fight during this stretch. The number two and three heavyweight contenders respectively, Clay and Jones fought on Jones' home turf at New York's [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]]. Jones staggered Clay in the first round, and the unanimous decision for Clay was greeted by boos and a rain of debris thrown into the ring. Watching on closed-circuit TV, heavyweight champ Sonny Liston quipped that if he fought Clay he might get locked up for murder.

In each of these fights, Clay vocally belittled his opponents and vaunted his abilities. He called Jones "an ugly little man" and Cooper a "bum".

In 1960 Clay left Moore's camp, partially due to Clay's refusal to do chores such as washing dishes and sweeping. To replace Moore, Clay hired [[Angelo Dundee]] to be his trainer.

===World heavyweight champion===
====Fights against Liston====
{{Main|Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston}}
By late 1963, Clay had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's title. The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in [[Miami Beach]]. Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. Based on Clay's uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston's destruction of former heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]] in two first-round knockouts, Clay was a 7–1 underdog. Despite this, Clay taunted Liston during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing him "the big ugly bear", stating "Liston even smells like a bear" and claiming "After I beat him I'm going to donate him to the zoo."<ref>[{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=vkvoAgAAQBAJ|page=147|text=Liston even smells like a bear}} Remnick (1998), p. 147]</ref> Clay turned the pre-fight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Liston that "someone is going to die at ringside tonight." Clay's pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54.<ref name="Liston">{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Lipsyte |title=Clay Wins Title in Seventh-Round Upset As Liston Is Halted by Shoulder Injury |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/25/specials/ali-upset.html |work=The New York Times |date=February 26, 1964 |accessdate=December 27, 2008}}</ref> Many of those in attendance thought Clay's behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout.

The outcome of the fight was a major upset. At the opening bell, Liston rushed at Clay, seemingly angry and looking for a quick knockout. However, Clay's superior speed and mobility enabled him to elude Liston, making the champion miss and look awkward. At the end of the first round, Clay opened up his attack and hit Liston repeatedly with jabs. Liston fought better in round two, but at the beginning of the third round Clay hit Liston with a combination that buckled his knees and opened a cut under his left eye. This was the first time Liston had ever been cut. At the end of round four, Clay was returning to his corner when he began experiencing blinding pain in his eyes and asked his trainer, [[Angelo Dundee]], to cut off his gloves. Dundee refused. It has been speculated that the problem was due to ointment used to seal Liston's cuts, perhaps deliberately applied by his corner to his gloves.<ref name="Liston" /> Though unconfirmed, boxing historian [[Bert Sugar]] said that two of Liston's opponents also complained about their eyes "burning".<ref>{{cite book |last=Sugar |first=Bert Randolph |title=Bert Sugar on Boxing: The Best of the Sport's Most Notable Writer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tJ2uBBsN0E0C |date=November 1, 2003 |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=978-1-59228-048-3 |page=196}}</ref><ref>In an interview in 1974, Ali said that, prior to his later fight with Foreman, a one-time member of Liston's entourage offered him a liniment that could be applied to boxing gloves and that would cause a blinding, temporary stinging of the eyes. {{YouTube|nKGdopYDIWU}}</ref>

Despite Liston's attempts to knock out a blinded Clay, Clay was able to survive the fifth round until sweat and tears rinsed the irritation from his eyes. In the sixth, Clay dominated, hitting Liston repeatedly. Liston did not answer the bell for the seventh round, and Clay was declared the winner by [[Technical knockout|TKO]]. Liston stated that the reason he quit was an injured shoulder. Following the win, a triumphant Clay rushed to the edge of the ring and, pointing to the ringside press, shouted: "Eat your words!" He added, "I am the greatest! I shook up the world. I'm the prettiest thing that ever lived."<ref>McLeod, Kembrew, ''Pranksters: Making Mischief in the Modern World'', pp. 223–4.</ref>

At ringside post fight, Clay appeared unconvinced that the fight was stopped due to a Liston shoulder injury, saying that the only injury Liston had was "an open eye, a big cut eye!" When told by Joe Louis that the injury was a "left arm thrown out of its socket," Clay quipped, "Yeah, swinging at nothing, who wouldn't?"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4IKMX-5JLk "Cassius Clay vs. Sonny Liston - 1964 Boxen"]. YouTube.</ref>

In winning this fight at the age of 22, Clay became the youngest boxer to take the title from a reigning heavyweight champion. However, [[Floyd Patterson]] remained the youngest to win the heavyweight championship, doing so at the age 21 during an elimination bout following [[Rocky Marciano]]'s retirement. [[Mike Tyson]] broke both records in 1986 when he defeated [[Trevor Berbick]] to win the heavyweight title at age 20.

Soon after the Liston fight, Clay changed his name to Cassius X, and then later to Muhammad Ali upon converting to [[Islam]] and affiliating with the Nation of Islam. Ali then faced a rematch with Liston scheduled for May 1965 in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. It had been scheduled for Boston the previous November, but was postponed for six months due to Ali's emergency surgery for a hernia three days before.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cuddy |first=Jack |title=Clay Undergoes Surgery; Fight Is Off Indefinitely |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9544811/the_bridgeport_telegram/ |newspaper=[[The Bridgeport Telegram]] |date=November 14, 1964 |page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=March 14, 2017}} {{free access}}</ref> The fight was controversial. Midway through the first round, Liston was knocked down by a difficult-to-see blow the press dubbed a "phantom punch". Referee [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] did not begin the count immediately after the knockdown, as Ali refused to retreat to a neutral corner. Liston rose after he had been down for about 20 seconds, and the fight momentarily continued. However a few seconds later Walcott, having been informed by the timekeepers that Liston had been down for a count of 10, stopped the match and declared Ali the winner by knockout.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXYwb2C6Hec |title=Muhammad Ali vs Sonny Liston I & II – Highlights (Ali Becomes World Champion & Phantom Punch Fight!) |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=June 20, 2018}}</ref> The entire fight lasted less than two minutes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/16/sports/sports-of-the-times-on-his-50th-ali-is-still-the-greatest.html |work=The New York Times |title=Sports of The Times; On His 50th, Ali Is Still 'The Greatest' |date=January 16, 1992 |accessdate=January 25, 2012 |first1=Dave |last1=Anderson}}</ref>

It has since been speculated that Liston purposely dropped to the ground. Proposed motivations include threats on his life from the Nation of Islam, that he had bet against himself and that he "took a dive" to pay off debts. Slow-motion replays show that Liston was jarred by a chopping right from Ali, although it is unclear whether the blow was a genuine knockout punch.<ref>{{cite book |last=Vachss |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Vachss |url=http://www.vachss.com/only_child/index.html |title=Only Child |page=89 |publisher=Vintage |year=2003}} Vachss further explains the way such a fix would have been engineered in {{cite book |url=http://twotrainsrunning.com/ |title=Two Trains Running |pages=160–165, 233 |publisher=Pantheon |year=2005}}</ref>

====Fight against Patterson====
{{Main|Muhammad Ali vs. Floyd Patterson}}

Ali defended his title against former heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]] on November 22, 1965. Before the match, Ali mocked Patterson, who was widely known to call him by his former name Cassius Clay, as an "[[Uncle Tom syndrome|Uncle Tom]]", calling him "The Rabbit". Although Ali clearly had the better of Patterson, who appeared injured during the fight, the match lasted 12 rounds before being called on a technical knockout. Patterson later said he had strained his [[Sacroiliac joint|sacroiliac]]. Ali was criticized in the sports media for appearing to have toyed with Patterson during the fight.<ref name=Belth>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/37158310/ |agency=Sports on Earth |title=ALI-PATTERSON: THE REAL STORY |journal=Sports on Earth |date=August 27, 2012 |accessdate=June 3, 2016 |first=Alex |last=Belth}}</ref> Patterson biographer W. K. Stratton claims that the conflict between Ali and Patterson was not genuine but was staged to increase ticket sales and the closed-circuit viewing audience, with both men complicit in the theatrics. Stratton also cites an interview by [[Howard Cosell]] in which Ali explained that rather than toying with Patterson, he refrained from knocking him out after it became apparent Patterson was injured. Patterson later said that he had never been hit by punches as soft as Ali's. Stratton states that Ali arranged the second fight, in 1972, with the financially struggling Patterson to help the former champion earn enough money to pay a debt to the [[IRS]].<ref name=Belth/>

====Main Bout====
After the Patterson fight, Ali founded his own promotion company, Main Bout. The company mainly handled Ali's boxing promotions and [[pay-per-view]] [[closed-circuit television]] broadcasts. The company's stockholders were mainly fellow Nation of Islam members, along with several others, including [[Bob Arum]].<ref name="Ezra105">{{cite book |last=Ezra |first=Michael |title=The Economic Civil Rights Movement: African Americans and the Struggle for Economic Power |date=2013 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9781136274756 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DL41bsCigZcC&pg=PA105 |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Muhammad Ali 1966.jpg|thumb|left|Ali in court with promoter and lawyer [[Bob Arum]], 1966]]
Ali and then-[[World Boxing Association|WBA]] heavyweight champion boxer [[Ernie Terrell]] had agreed to meet for a bout in Chicago on March 29, 1966 (the WBA, one of two boxing associations, had stripped Ali of his title following his joining the Nation of Islam). But in February Ali was reclassified by the Louisville draft board as 1-A from 1-Y, and he indicated that he would refuse to serve, commenting to the press, "I ain't got nothing against no [[Viet Cong]]; no Viet Cong never called me nigger."<ref>{{cite news |last=Shalit |first=Nevin I. |title=Muhammad Ali: Losing the Real Title |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1980/7/15/muhammad-ali-losing-the-real-title/ |newspaper=The Harvard Crimson |date=July 15, 1980 |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref> Amidst the media and public outcry over Ali's stance, the Illinois Athletic Commission refused to sanction the fight, citing technicalities.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |title=He Could Go To Jail And Still Be Champ |date=August 28, 1967 |first1=Angelo |last1=Dundee |first2=Tex |last2=Maule}}</ref>

Instead, Ali traveled to Canada and Europe and won championship bouts against [[George Chuvalo]], [[Henry Cooper]], [[Brian London]] and [[Karl Mildenberger]].

Ali returned to the United States to fight [[Cleveland Williams]] in the Houston Astrodome on November 14, 1966. The bout drew a record-breaking indoor crowd of 35,460 people. Williams had once been considered among the hardest punchers in the heavyweight division, but in 1964 he had been shot at point-blank range by a Texas policeman, resulting in the loss of one kidney and {{convert|10|ft|m|disp=flip}} of his small intestine. Ali dominated Williams, winning a third-round technical knockout in what some consider the finest performance of his career.

Ali fought Terrell in Houston on February 6, 1967. Terrell, who was unbeaten in five years and had defeated many of the boxers Ali had faced, was billed as Ali's toughest opponent since Liston; he was big, strong and had a three-inch reach advantage over Ali. During the lead up to the bout, Terrell repeatedly called Ali "Clay", much to Ali's annoyance. The two almost came to blows over the name issue in a pre-fight interview with Howard Cosell. Ali seemed intent on humiliating Terrell. "I want to torture him", he said. "A clean knockout is too good for him."<ref>{{cite news |first=Tex |last=Maule |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1079523/1/index.htm |title=Cruel Ali With All The Skills |date=February 13, 1967 |work=Sports Illustrated |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309201457/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1079523/1/index.htm |archivedate=March 9, 2013}}</ref> The fight was close until the seventh round, when Ali bloodied Terrell and almost knocked him out. In the eighth round, Ali taunted Terrell, hitting him with jabs and shouting between punches, "What's my name, Uncle Tom ... what's my name?" Ali won a unanimous 15-round decision. Terrell claimed that early in the fight Ali deliberately thumbed him in the eye, forcing him to fight half-blind, and then, in a clinch, rubbed the wounded eye against the ropes. Because of Ali's apparent intent to prolong the fight to inflict maximum punishment, critics described the bout as "one of the ugliest boxing fights." [[Tex Maule]] later wrote: "It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty." Ali denied the accusations of cruelty but, for Ali's critics, the fight provided more evidence of his arrogance.

After Ali's title defense against [[Zora Folley]] on March 22, he was stripped of his title due to his refusal to be drafted to army service.<ref name="greatath" /> His boxing license was also suspended by the state of New York. He was convicted of draft evasion on June 20 and sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. He paid a bond and remained free while the verdict was being appealed.

===Exile and comeback===
In March 1966, Ali [[#Vietnam War and resistance to the draft|refused to be inducted into the armed forces]]. He was systematically denied a boxing license in every state and stripped of his passport. As a result, he did not fight from March 1967 to October 1970—from ages 25 to almost 29—as his case worked its way through the appeals process before his conviction was overturned in 1971. During this time of inactivity, as [[opposition to the Vietnam War]] began to grow and Ali's stance gained sympathy, he spoke at colleges across the nation, criticizing the Vietnam War and advocating African-American pride and racial justice.

====''The Super Fight''====
{{Main|The Super Fight}}
While banned from sanctioned bouts, Ali settled a $1&nbsp;million lawsuit against radio producer Murray Woroner by accepting $10,000 to appear in a privately staged fantasy fight against retired champion Rocky Marciano.<ref name="Enterprise News Sep 2009">{{cite news |title=Ali vs. Marciano: Who wins? |url=http://www.enterprisenews.com/article/20090901/News/309019646 |work=The Enterprise |date=September 1, 2009 |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref> In 1969 the boxers were filmed sparring for about 75 one-minute rounds; they produced several potential outcomes.<ref name="The Guardian Nov 2012">{{cite news |title=The forgotten story of ... the Rocky Marciano v Muhammad Ali Super Fight |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/nov/13/forgotten-story-rocky-marciano-muhammad-ali |date=November 13, 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> A computer program purportedly determined the winner, based on data about the fighters, along with the opinions of approximately 250 boxing experts.

Ali suggested that prejudice determined his defeat in the U.S. version. He was reported to jokingly say, "That computer was made in Alabama."<ref name="Enterprise News Sep 2009" />

====Return to prizefighting====
On August 11, 1970, with his case still in appeal, Ali was granted a license to box by the City of Atlanta Athletic Commission. [[Leroy Johnson (Georgia politician)|Leroy Johnson]], [[Jesse Hill Jr.]] and [[Harry Pett]] had used their local political influence and set up the company House of Sports to organize the fight, underlining the influence power of Georgia's black politics in Ali' s comeback.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlantamagazine.com/great-reads/knockout-oral-history-muhammad-ali-atlanta-fight-nobody-wanted/|title=Knockout: An oral history of Muhammad Ali, Atlanta, and the fight nobody wanted|last=Matthew|date=2005-10-01|website=Atlanta Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Ali's first return bout was against [[Jerry Quarry]] on October 26, resulting in a win after three rounds after Quarry was cut.

A month earlier, a victory in federal court forced the New York State Boxing Commission to reinstate Ali's license.<ref name=cgnyrl >{{cite news |url=http://palmbeachpost.newspapers.com/image/132677737/?terms=%22Clay%2Bgranted%2BNew%2BYork%2Bring%2Blicense%22 |newspaper=The Palm Beach Post |agency=Associated Press |title=Clay granted New York ring license |date=September 15, 1970 |page=B4 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> He fought [[Oscar Bonavena]] at Madison Square Garden in December, an uninspired performance that ended in a dramatic [[technical knockout]] of Bonavena in the 15th round. The win left Ali as a top contender against heavyweight champion [[Joe Frazier]].

====First fight against Joe Frazier====
{{Main|Fight of the Century}}
Ali and Frazier's first fight, held at the Garden on March 8, 1971, was nicknamed the "[[Fight of the Century]]", due to the tremendous excitement surrounding a bout between two undefeated fighters, each with a legitimate claim to be heavyweight champion. Veteran boxing writer John Condon called it "the greatest event I've ever worked on in my life." The bout was broadcast to 35 foreign countries; promoters granted 760 press passes.<ref name="Hauser 2004" />

Adding to the atmosphere were the considerable pre-fight theatrics and name calling. Ali portrayed Frazier as a "dumb tool of the white establishment." "Frazier is too ugly to be champ", Ali said. "Frazier is too dumb to be champ." Ali also frequently called Frazier an "Uncle Tom". Dave Wolf, who worked in Frazier's camp, recalled that, "Ali was saying 'the only people rooting for Joe Frazier are white people in suits, Alabama sheriffs, and members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. I'm fighting for the little man in the ghetto.' Joe was sitting there, smashing his fist into the palm of his hand, saying, 'What the fuck does he know about the ghetto?{{' "}}<ref name="Hauser 2004" />

Ali began training at a farm near [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], in 1971 and, finding the country setting to his liking, sought to develop a [[Muhammad Ali's Deer Lake Training Camp|real training camp]] in the countryside. He found a five-acre site on a Pennsylvania country road in the village of Deer Lake, Pennsylvania. On this site, Ali carved out what was to become his training camp, where he trained for all his fights from 1972 to the end of his career in 1981.

The Monday night fight lived up to its billing. In a preview of their two other fights, a crouching, bobbing and weaving Frazier constantly pressured Ali, getting hit regularly by Ali jabs and combinations, but relentlessly attacking and scoring repeatedly, especially to Ali's body. The fight was even in the early rounds, but Ali was taking more punishment than ever in his career. On several occasions in the early rounds he played to the crowd and shook his head "no" after he was hit. In the later rounds—in what was the first appearance of the "[[rope-a-dope]] strategy"—Ali leaned against the ropes and absorbed punishment from Frazier, hoping to tire him. In the 11th round, Frazier connected with a left hook that wobbled Ali, but because it appeared that Ali might be clowning as he staggered backwards across the ring, Frazier hesitated to press his advantage, fearing an Ali counter-attack. In the final round, Frazier knocked Ali down with a vicious left hook, which referee [[Arthur Mercante]] said was as hard as a man can be hit. Ali was back on his feet in three seconds.<ref name="Hauser 2004" /> Nevertheless, Ali lost by unanimous decision, his first professional defeat.

====Chamberlain challenge and Ellis fight====
{{Main|Muhammad Ali vs. Jimmy Ellis}}
In 1971, basketball star [[Wilt Chamberlain]] challenged Ali to a fight, and a bout was scheduled for July 26. Although the seven-foot-two-inch tall Chamberlain had formidable physical advantages over Ali—weighing 60{{nbsp}}pounds more and able to reach 14{{nbsp}}inches further—Ali was able to influence Chamberlain into calling off the bout by taunting him with calls of "Timber!" and "The tree will fall" during a shared interview. These statements of confidence unsettled his taller opponent, whom [[Los Angeles Lakers]] owner [[Jack Kent Cooke]] had offered a record-setting contract, conditional on Chamberlain agreeing to abandon what Cooke termed "this boxing foolishness",<ref>{{cite news |title=Ali's Remark Ended Wilt's Ring Career |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-15/sports/sp-979_1_wilt-s-ring-career |accessdate= |at=Morning Briefing |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 15, 1989}}</ref> and he did exactly that.<ref>{{cite news |last1=O'Reilly |first1=Terry |title=Achilles Heel Advertising: Repositioning the Competition |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/achilles-heel-advertising-repositioning-the-competition-1.3473631 |accessdate=August 30, 2018 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=March 3, 2016}}</ref> To replace Ali's opponent, promoter [[Bob Arum]] quickly booked a former sparring partner of Ali's, [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]], who was a childhood friend from [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to fight him.

====Fights against Quarry, Patterson, Foster and Norton====
After the loss to Frazier, Ali fought Jerry Quarry, had a second bout with Floyd Patterson and faced [[Bob Foster (boxer)|Bob Foster]] in 1972, winning a total of six fights that year. In 1973, [[Ken Norton]] broke Ali's jaw while giving him the second loss of his career. After initially considering retirement, Ali won a controversial decision against Norton in their second bout. This led to a rematch with Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 1974; Frazier had recently lost his title to George Foreman.

====Second fight against Joe Frazier====
{{Main|Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II}}
Ali was strong in the early rounds of the fight, and staggered Frazier in the second round. Referee Tony Perez mistakenly thought he heard the bell ending the round and stepped between the two fighters as Ali was pressing his attack, giving Frazier time to recover. However, Frazier came on in the middle rounds, snapping Ali's head in round seven and driving him to the ropes at the end of round eight. The last four rounds saw round-to-round shifts in momentum between the two fighters. Throughout most of the bout, however, Ali was able to circle away from Frazier's dangerous left hook and to tie Frazier up when he was cornered, the latter a tactic that Frazier's camp complained of bitterly. Judges awarded Ali a unanimous decision.

===World heavyweight champion (second reign)===
====''The Rumble in the Jungle''====
{{Main|The Rumble in the Jungle}}
The defeat of Frazier set the stage for a title fight against heavyweight champion [[George Foreman]] in Kinshasa, [[Zaire]], on October 30, 1974—a bout nicknamed ''[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]''. Foreman was considered one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history. In assessing the fight, analysts pointed out that [[Joe Frazier]] and [[Ken Norton]], who had given Ali four tough battles and won two of them, had both been devastated by Foreman in second-round knockouts. Ali was 32 years old, and had clearly lost speed and reflexes since his twenties. Contrary to his later persona, Foreman was at the time a brooding and intimidating presence. Almost no one associated with the sport, not even Ali's long-time supporter Howard Cosell, gave the former champion a chance of winning.

As usual, Ali was confident and colorful before the fight. He told interviewer [[David Frost]], "If you think the world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait till I whup Foreman's behind!"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aGHpXt_hMc |title=Muhammad Ali – The Rumble In The Jungle(Interview) |publisher=YouTube |date=March 22, 1967 |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref> He told the press, "I've done something new for this fight. I done wrestled with an alligator, I done tussled with a whale; handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail; only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick; I'm so mean I make medicine sick."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGk0R63C0eM |title=Muhammad Ali Inspirational Speech (Cassius Clay Boxing Motivation) |publisher=YouTube |date=September 14, 2012 |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref> Ali was wildly popular in Zaire, with crowds chanting "Ali, bomaye" ("Ali, kill him") wherever he went.

Ali opened the fight moving and scoring with right crosses to Foreman's head. Then, beginning in the second round, and to the consternation of his corner, Ali retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counter-punching, all while verbally taunting Foreman. The move, which would later become known as the "[[Rope-a-dope]]", so violated conventional boxing wisdom—letting one of the hardest hitters in boxing strike at will—that at ringside writer [[George Plimpton]] thought the fight had to be fixed.<ref name="Hauser 2004" /> Foreman, increasingly angered, threw punches that were deflected and did not land squarely. Midway through the fight, as Foreman began tiring, Ali countered more frequently and effectively with punches and flurries, which electrified the pro-Ali crowd. In the eighth round, Ali dropped an exhausted Foreman with a combination at center ring; Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, and amidst pandemonium in the ring, Ali had regained the title by knockout. Reflecting on the fight, George Foreman later said: "I thought Ali was just one more knockout victim until, about the seventh round, I hit him hard to the jaw and he held me and whispered in my ear: 'That all you got, George?' I realized that this ain't what I thought it was."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Foreman |first=George |url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/sport/george-foreman-on-ali |title=George Foreman on why Muhammad Ali was so much more than a 'boxer' |magazine=[[ShortList]] |date=January 2012 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}</ref>

====Fights against Wepner, Lyle and Bugner====
Ali's next opponents included [[Chuck Wepner]], [[Ron Lyle]], and [[Joe Bugner]]. Wepner, a journeyman known as "The Bayonne Bleeder", stunned Ali with a knockdown in the ninth round; Ali would later say he tripped on Wepner's foot. It was a bout that would inspire [[Sylvester Stallone]] to create the acclaimed film, ''[[Rocky (film)|Rocky]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/10/rocky-stallone-settlement-cx_rs_0810autofacescan04.html#34f600e166bd |title=Stallone Settles With The 'Real' Rocky |first=R.

====Third fight against Joe Frazier====
{{Main|Thrilla in Manila}}
Ali then agreed to a third match with Joe Frazier in [[Manila]]. The bout, known as the "[[Thrilla in Manila]]", was held on October 1, 1975,<ref name="greatath" /> in temperatures approaching {{convert|100|°F|°C}}. In the first rounds, Ali was aggressive, moving and exchanging blows with Frazier. However, Ali soon appeared to tire and adopted the "rope-a-dope" strategy, frequently resorting to clinches. During this part of the bout Ali did some effective counter-punching, but for the most part absorbed punishment from a relentlessly attacking Frazier. In the 12th round, Frazier began to tire, and Ali scored several sharp blows that closed Frazier's left eye and opened a cut over his right eye. With Frazier's vision now diminished, Ali dominated the 13th and 14th rounds, at times conducting what boxing historian Mike Silver called "target practice" on Frazier's head. The fight was stopped when Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to answer the bell for the 15th and final round, despite Frazier's protests. Frazier's eyes were both swollen shut. Ali, in his corner, winner by TKO, slumped on his stool, clearly spent.

An ailing Ali said afterwards that the fight "was the closest thing to dying that I know", and, when later asked if he had viewed the fight on videotape, reportedly said, "Why would I want to go back and see Hell?" After the fight he cited Frazier as "the greatest fighter of all times next to me."

After the third fight with Frazier, Ali considered retirement. He said, “I’m sore all over. My arms, my face, my sides all ache. I’m so, so tired. There is a great possibility that I will retire. You might have seen the last of me. I want to sit back and count my money, live in my house and my farm, work for my people and concentrate on my family." <ref>{{cite web|url=https://fight-library.com/2019/05/28/history-lesson-thrilla-in-manila/ |title=History Lesson: Thrilla in Manila|publisher=Fight-Library.com|author=Blaine Henry|date=May 18, 2019}}</ref>

===Later career===
[[File:Anderson ali.jpg|thumb|Ali being interviewed by [[WBAL-TV]]'s [[Curt Anderson]], 1978, Baltimore, Maryland]]
Following the Manila bout, Ali fought [[Jean-Pierre Coopman]], [[Jimmy Young (boxer)|Jimmy Young]], and [[Richard Dunn (boxer)|Richard Dunn]], winning the last by knockout. The punch Ali used to knock Dunn out was taught to him by [[Taekwondo]] [[Grandmaster (martial arts)|Grandmaster]] [[Jhoon Goo Rhee|Jhoon Rhee]]. Rhee called that punch the "Accupunch"; he learned it from [[Bruce Lee]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jhoonrhee.com/bio7.html |title=Jhoon Rhee, Father of American Tae Kwon Do |website=www.jhoonrhee.com|access-date=May 1, 2019}}</ref> The Dunn fight was the last time Ali would knock down an opponent in his boxing career.

On June 1, 1976, Ali removed his shirt and jacket and confronted [[professional wrestler]] [[Gorilla Monsoon]] in the ring after his match at a [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]] show in [[Philadelphia Arena]]. After dodging a few punches, Monsoon put Ali in an [[airplane spin]] and dumped him to the mat. Ali stumbled to the corner, where his associate [[Butch Lewis]] convinced him to walk away.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxinghalloffame.com/muhammad-ali-boxing-a-monsoon/ |title=Muhammad Ali Boxing a Monsoon – Boxing Hall of Fame |date=December 29, 2012 |publisher=boxinghalloffame.com |accessdate=June 9, 2016}}</ref>

Ali fought Ken Norton for the third time in September 1976. The bout, which was held at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], resulted in Ali winning a heavily contested decision that was loudly booed by the audience. Afterwards, he announced he was retiring from boxing to practice his faith, having converted to [[Sunni Islam]] after falling out with the Nation of Islam the previous year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=110827611?sec=Sports |title=Champion Ali Quits Boxing |work=The Paris News |page=12 |accessdate=October 19, 2011 |date=October 1, 1976}}</ref>

After returning to beat [[Alfredo Evangelista]] in May 1977, Ali struggled in his next fight against [[Earnie Shavers]] that September, getting pummeled a few times by punches to the head. Ali won the fight by another unanimous decision, but the bout caused his longtime doctor [[Ferdie Pacheco]] to quit after he was rebuffed for telling Ali he should retire. Pacheco was quoted as saying, "the New York State Athletic Commission gave me a report that showed Ali's kidneys were falling apart. I wrote to Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, his wife and Ali himself. I got nothing back in response. That's when I decided enough is enough."<ref name="Hauser 2004" />

In February 1978, Ali faced [[Leon Spinks]] at the Hilton Hotel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. At the time, Spinks had only seven professional fights to his credit, and had recently fought a draw with journeyman Scott LeDoux. Ali sparred less than two dozen rounds in preparation for the fight, and was seriously out of shape by the opening bell. He lost the title by split decision. A rematch occurred in September at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]] in New Orleans, Louisiana. 70,000 people attended the bout and paid a total of $6&nbsp;million admission, making it the largest live gate in boxing history at that time.<ref name="Times-Picayune, New Orleans, Peter Finney's column from 1978">[http://www.nola.com/sports/index.ssf/2016/06/read_peter_finneys_column_from.html Read Peter Finney's column on Ali vs. Spinks 2 at the Superdome in 1978], ''The Times-Picayune'' NOLA.com (New Orleans, LA.), re-posted on June 4, 2016.</ref> Ali won a unanimous decision in an uninspiring fight, with referee Lucien Joubert scoring rounds 10-4, judge Ernie Cojoe 10-4, and judge Herman Preis 11-4.

Following this win, on July 27, 1979, Ali announced his retirement from boxing. His retirement was short-lived, however; Ali announced his comeback to face [[Larry Holmes]] for the WBC belt in an attempt to win the heavyweight championship an unprecedented fourth time. The fight was largely motivated by Ali's need for money. Boxing writer Richie Giachetti said, "Larry didn't want to fight Ali. He knew Ali had nothing left; he knew it would be a horror."

It was around this time that Ali started struggling with vocal stutters and trembling hands.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/21/us/muhammad-ali---fast-facts/ |title=Muhammad Ali Fast Facts |publisher=CNN |accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref> The [[Nevada Athletic Commission]] (NAC) ordered that he undergo a complete physical in Las Vegas before being allowed to fight again. Ali chose instead to check into the [[Mayo Clinic]], who declared him fit to fight. Their opinion was accepted by the NAC on July 31, 1980, paving the way for Ali's return to the ring.<ref name="LVSun 50">{{cite news |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/muhammad-ali/timeline/ |title=Timeline: Fifty years of Las Vegas memories for Muhammad Ali |newspaper=Las Vegas Sun |accessdate=November 12, 2013 |last=Koch |first=Ed}}</ref>

The fight took place on October 2, 1980, in Las Vegas Valley, with Holmes easily dominating Ali, who was weakened from thyroid medication he had taken to lose weight. Giachetti called the fight "awful ... the worst sports event I ever had to cover." Actor [[Sylvester Stallone]] was at ringside and said that it was like watching an autopsy on a man who is still alive.<ref name="Hauser 2004" /> In the eleventh round, Angelo Dundee told the referee to stop the fight, making it the only time that Ali ever lost by [[technical knockout|stoppage]].

Ali was married four times and had seven daughters and two sons. Ali was introduced to cocktail waitress Sonji Roi by Herbert Muhammad and asked her to marry him after their first date.

===Religion and beliefs===
{{Main|Religious views of Muhammad Ali}}

====Affiliation with the Nation of Islam====
Ali said that he first heard of the [[Nation of Islam]] when he was fighting in the Golden Gloves tournament in Chicago in 1959, and attended his first Nation of Islam meeting in 1961. He continued to attend meetings, although keeping his involvement hidden from the public. In 1962, Clay met [[Malcolm X]], who soon became his spiritual and political mentor.<ref name="Guardian Mitchell">{{cite news |last=Mitchell |first=Kevin |title=From the Vietnam war to Islam – the key chapters in Ali's life |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/04/muhammad-ali-key-chapters |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 4, 2016 |accessdate=June 5, 2016}}</ref> By the time of the first Liston fight, Nation of Islam members, including Malcolm X, were visible in his entourage. This led to a story in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' just before the fight disclosing that Clay had joined the Nation of Islam, which nearly caused the bout to be canceled. The article quoted Cassius Clay Sr. as saying that his son had joined the [[African American Muslims|Black Muslims]] when he was 18.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19640207&id=XF4bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-04EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5091,2145696 |newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press |title=Muslim Charge Clams Up Clay |date=February 7, 1964}}</ref>

[[File:Elijah Muhammad and Cassius Clay NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|Ali (seen in background) at an address by [[Elijah Muhammad]] in 1964]]
In fact, Clay was initially refused entry to the Nation of Islam (often called the Black [[Muslim]]s at the time) due to his boxing career. However, after he won the championship from Liston in 1964, the Nation of Islam was more receptive and agreed to publicize his membership.<ref name="Guardian Mitchell" /> Shortly afterwards on March 6, Elijah Muhammad gave a radio address that Clay would be renamed [[Muhammad]] (one who is worthy of praise) [[Ali (name)|Ali]] (most high).<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00014063.html |title=He is simply ... The Greatest |last=Schwartz |first=Larry |publisher=ESPN |access-date=March 4, 2018}}</ref> Around that time Ali moved to the south side of Chicago and lived in a series of houses, always near the Nation of Islam's [[Mosque Maryam]] or Elijah Muhammad's residence.

Only a few journalists, most notably Howard Cosell, accepted the new name at that time. Ali stated that his earlier name was a "[[slave name]]," and added that "I didn’t choose it and I don’t want it".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p014mvdx |title=History website, Muhammad Ali: "Cassius Clay is my slave name" |publisher=BBC |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}</ref> The person he was named after was [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (politician)|a white man and emancipationist who fought for the rights of black people]].<ref>https://news.yale.edu/2016/06/09/muhammad-ali-originally-named-ardent-abolitionist-and-yale-alumnus-cassius-clay.

Aligning himself with the Nation of Islam, its leader [[Elijah Muhammad]], and a narrative that labeled the white race as the perpetrator of genocide against African Americans made Ali a target of public condemnation. The Nation of Islam was widely viewed by whites and some African Americans as a black separatist "hate religion" with a propensity toward violence; Ali had few qualms about using his influential voice to speak Nation of Islam doctrine.<ref name="thegrio.com">{{cite web |last=Garcia |first=Courtney |url=http://thegrio.com/2013/09/06/trials-of-muhammad-ali-highlights-boxers-anti-war-opposition/ |title='Trials of Muhammad Ali' highlights boxer's anti-war opposition |publisher=theGrio |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref> In a press conference articulating his opposition to the Vietnam War, Ali stated, "My enemy is the white people, not Viet Cong or Chinese or Japanese."<ref name="tribune">{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-08-31/entertainment/ct-ae-0901-fall-movie-profile-20130831_1_muhammad-ali-opposer-chicago-director |title=The trials of a Chicago director making Muhammad Ali doc |website=Chicago Tribune |first=Nina |last=Metz |date=August 31, 2013 |accessdate=July 31, 2016}}</ref> In relation to integration, he said: "We who follow the teachings of Elijah Muhammad don't want to be forced to integrate.

Writer [[Jerry Izenberg]] once noted that, "the Nation became Ali's family and Elijah Muhammad became his father. But there is an irony to the fact that while the Nation branded white people as devils, Ali had more white colleagues than most African American people did at that time in America, and continued to have them throughout his career."<ref name="Hauser 2004" />

====Conversion to Sunni/Sufi Islam====

In a 2004 autobiography, Ali attributed his conversion to mainstream Sunni Islam to [[Warith Deen Muhammad]], who assumed leadership of the Nation of Islam upon the death of his father Elijah Muhammad, and persuaded the Nation's followers to become adherents of Sunni Islam.<ref name = "Soul of a Butterfly 85">{{cite book |title=The Soul of a Butterfly |first1=Muhammad |last1=Ali |first2=Hana Yasmeen |last2=Ali |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=85 |year=2013}}</ref>

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, he stated that "Islam is a [[religion of peace]]" and "does not promote terrorism or killing people", and that he was "angry that the world sees a certain group of Islam followers who caused this destruction, but they are not real Muslims. They are racist fanatics who call themselves Muslims." In December 2015, he stated that "True Muslims know that the ruthless violence of so-called Islamic [[jihadists]] goes against the very tenets of our religion", that "We as Muslims have to stand up to those who use Islam to advance their own personal agenda", and that "political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam, and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people's views on what Islam really is."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/muhammad-ali-face-real-islam-160606040559103.html |title=Muhammad Ali: The face of 'real Islam' |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=June 6, 2016 |accessdate=September 4, 2016}}</ref>

Ali later moved away from Inayat Khan's teachings of [[Universal Sufism]] after traditional Sunni-Sufis criticized the movement as being contrary to the actual teachings of Sunni Islam.

At the trial on June 20, 1967, the jury found Ali guilty after only 21{{nbsp}}minutes of deliberation of the criminal offense of violating the [[Military Selective Service Act|Selective Service laws]] by refusing to be drafted.<ref name="greatath" /> After a Court of Appeals upheld the conviction, the case was reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/698 |title=Cassius Marsellus CLAY, Jr. also known as Muhammad Ali, Petitioner, v. UNITED STATES. |website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>

Ali remained free in the years between the Appellate Court decision and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling. As public opinion began turning people against the war and the Civil Rights Movement continued to gather momentum, Ali became a popular speaker at colleges and universities across the country; this itinerary was rare if not unprecedented for a prizefighter. At [[Howard University]], for example, he gave his popular "Black Is Best" speech to 4,000 cheering students and community intellectuals, after he was invited to speak by sociology professor [[Nathan Hare]] on behalf of the Black Power Committee, a student protest group.<ref>{{cite news |title="The Greatest" Is Gone |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919377-5,00.html |page=5 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=February 27, 1978 |accessdate=August 4, 2007}}</ref>

On June 28, 1971, the Supreme Court of the United States in ''[[Clay v. United States]]'' overturned Ali's conviction by a unanimous 8–0 decision (Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] recused himself, as he had been the U.S. Solicitor General at the time of Ali's conviction).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/698 |title=Cassius Marsellus CLAY, Jr. also known as Muhammad Ali, Petitioner, v.

===Impact of Ali's draft refusal===
Ali's example inspired countless black Americans and others. ''The New York Times'' columnist [[William C. Rhoden|William Rhoden]] wrote, "Ali's actions changed my standard of what constituted an athlete's greatness. Possessing a killer jump shot or the ability to stop on a dime was no longer enough. What were you doing for the liberation of your people? What were you doing to help your country live up to the covenant of its founding principles?"<ref name="nytimes1" />

Recalling Ali's anti-war position, [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] said: "I remember the teachers at my high school didn't like Ali because he was so anti-establishment and he kind of thumbed his nose at authority and got away with it. The fact that he was proud to be a black man and that he had so much talent{{nbsp}} ... made some people think that he was dangerous. But for those very reasons I enjoyed him."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital.wustl.edu/e/eii/eiiweb/abd5427.5952.001kareemabdul-jabbar.html |title=Interview with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar |publisher=Digital.wustl.edu |date=March 3, 1989 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref>

Civil rights figures came to believe that Ali had an energizing effect on the freedom movement as a whole. [[Al Sharpton]] spoke of his bravery at a time when there was still widespread support for the Vietnam War. "For the heavyweight champion of the world, who had achieved the highest level of athletic celebrity, to put all of that on the line—the money, the ability to get endorsements—to sacrifice all of that for a cause, gave a whole sense of legitimacy to the movement and the causes with young people that nothing else could have done. Even those who were assassinated, certainly lost their lives, but they didn't voluntarily do that. He knew he was going to jail and did it anyway. That's another level of leadership and sacrifice."<ref>{{cite news |title=Muhammad Ali: The man who changed his sport and his country |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36450806 |publisher=BBC |date=June 5, 2016}}</ref>

Ali was honored with the annual Martin Luther King Award in 1970 by civil rights leader [[Ralph Abernathy]], who called him "a living example of soul power, the [[March on Washington]] in two fists." [[Coretta Scott King]] added that Ali was "a champion of justice and peace and unity."<ref name="Ezra82">{{cite book |last=Ezra |first=Michael |title=Muhammad Ali: The Making of an Icon |date=2009 |publisher=[[Temple University Press]] |isbn=9781592136612 |page=82 |chapter=Muhammad Ali's Main Bout: African American Economic Power and the World Heavyweight Title|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh3rtDyeSAIC&pg=PA82}}</ref>

In speaking of the cost on Ali's career of his refusal to be drafted, his trainer Angelo Dundee said, "One thing must be taken into account when talking about Ali: He was robbed of his best years, his prime years."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7470417/muhammad-ali-was-continues-greatest |title=Dundee: Ali was, still is 'The Greatest' |publisher=ESPN |date=January 17, 2012 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref>

[[Bob Arum]] did not support Ali's choice at the time. More recently, Arum stated that "when I look back at his life, and I was blessed to call him a friend and spent a lot of time with him, it's hard for me to talk about his exploits in boxing because as great as they were they paled in comparison to the impact that he had on the world," and "He did what he thought was right. And it turned out he was right, and I was wrong."<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-ali-arum/former-ali-promoter-bob-arum-recalls-boxers-impact-on-society-idUSKCN0YR01R?mod=related&channelName= Whitcomb, Dan] "Former Ali promoter Bob Arum recalls boxer's impact on society", Reuters, June 5, 2016.

===NSA and FBI monitoring of Ali's communications===
In a secret operation code-named "[[Project MINARET|Minaret]]", the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) intercepted the communications of leading Americans, including Ali, Senators [[Frank Church]] and [[Howard Baker]], [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], prominent U.S. journalists, and others who criticized the U.S. war in Vietnam.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/06/the-hidden-history-of-muhammad-ali/ |title=The Hidden History of Muhammad Ali |first=Dave |last=Zirin |magazine=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]] |date=June 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref><ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Pilkington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-anti-vietnam-muhammad-ali-mlk |title=Declassified NSA files show agency spied on Muhammad Ali and MLK |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 26, 2013 |accessdate=April 16, 2017}}</ref> A review by the NSA of the Minaret program concluded that it was "disreputable if not outright illegal."<ref name="theguardian.com" />

In 1971, his [[Fight of the Century]] with Frazier provided cover for an activist group, the [[Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI]], to pull off a burglary at an [[FBI]] office in Pennsylvania, which exposed the [[COINTELPRO]] operations that included illegal spying on activists involved with the civil rights and anti-war movements. One of the COINTELPRO targets was Ali, which included the FBI gaining access to his records as far back as elementary school; one such record mentioned him loving art as a child.<ref>{{cite web |last=Medsger |first=Betty |url=https://theintercept.com/2016/06/06/in-1971-muhammad-ali-helped-undermine-the-fbis-illegal-spying-on-americans/ |title=In 1971, Muhammad Ali Helped Undermine the FBI's Illegal Spying on Americans |work=[[The Intercept]] |date=June 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>

==Entertainment career==
{{See|Muhammad Ali in media and popular culture}}

===Acting===
Ali had a cameo role in the 1962 film version of ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]'', and during his exile from boxing, he starred in the short-lived 1969 Broadway musical, ''Buck White''. He also appeared in the documentary film ''[[Black Rodeo]]'' (1972) riding both a horse and a bull.

His autobiography ''[[The Greatest: My Own Story]]'', written with Richard Durham, was published in 1975.<ref name=cp>{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Muhammad |last2=Durham |first2=Richard |title=The Greatest: My Own Story |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EkfhAAAAMAAJ |date=October 1975 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=978-0-394-46268-4 |oclc=1622063}}</ref> In 1977 the book was adapted into a film called ''[[The Greatest (1977 film)|The Greatest]]'', in which Ali played himself and [[Ernest Borgnine]] played [[Angelo Dundee]].

The film ''[[Freedom Road]]'', made in 1978, features Ali in a rare acting role as Gideon Jackson, a former slave and Union (American Civil War) soldier in 1870s Virginia, who gets elected to the U.S. Senate and battles other former slaves and white sharecroppers to keep the land they have tended all their lives.

===Spoken word poetry and rap music===
Ali often used [[rhyme scheme]]s and spoken word poetry, both for when he was trash-talking in boxing and as political poetry for his activism outside of boxing. He played a role in the shaping of the black poetic tradition, paving the way for [[The Last Poets]] in 1968, [[Gil Scott-Heron]] in 1970, and the emergence of [[rap music]] in the 1970s.<ref name="nytimes2">{{cite news |last=Gates |first=Henry Louis Jr. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/09/opinion/muhammad-ali-the-political-poet.html |title=Muhammad Ali, the Political Poet |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 9, 2016 |accessdate=September 4, 2016}}</ref> According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', "Some have argued that" Ali was "the first [[rapper]]."<ref>{{cite news |title=Muhammad Ali's influence ran deep through rap's golden age |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jun/06/muhammad-ali-influence-rap-golden-age |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 6, 2016 |language=en}}</ref>

In 1963, Ali released an album of [[spoken word]] music on Columbia Records titled, ''[[I Am the Greatest (Cassius Clay album)|I Am the Greatest]]'', and in 1964, he recorded a [[cover version]] of the [[rhythm and blues]] song "[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTlN6pU01K0 |title=Song ''Stand By Me'', recorded in 1964 by Muhammad Ali, then known as Cassius Clay |publisher=YouTube |date=December 13, 2008 |accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secondhandsongs.com/performance/80810 |title=Different versions of 'Stand By Me' |publisher=Secondhandsongs.com |accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref> ''I Am the Greatest'' sold 500,000 copies, and has been identified as an early example of [[rap music]] and a precursor to [[hip hop]].<ref name="tinsley">{{cite news |last=Tinsley |first=Justin |title=The Grammy-nominated Cassius Clay |url=https://theundefeated.com/features/muhammad-ali-i-am-the-greatest-album/ |work=[[The Undefeated (website)|The Undefeated]] |date=June 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name="rollingstone">{{cite news |title=Muhammad Ali: Famed Pugilist Was Also Hip-Hop Pioneer |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/muhammad-ali-worlds-greatest-boxer-was-also-hip-hop-pioneer-20160604 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=June 4, 2016}}</ref> It reached number 61 on the album chart and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].

Ali was an influential figure in the world of [[hip hop music]].

In 1980, Ali was recruited by President [[Jimmy Carter]] for a diplomatic mission to Africa, in an effort to persuade a number of African governments to join the US-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] of the [[Moscow Olympics]] (in response to the [[Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan]]). According to Ali biographer Thomas Hauser, "at best, it was ill-conceived; at worst, a diplomatic disaster." The Tanzanian government was insulted that Carter had sent an athlete to discuss a serious political issue. One official asked whether the United States would "send [[Chris Evert]] to negotiate with London." Consequently, Ali was only received by the youth and culture minister, rather than President [[Julius Nyerere]]. Ali was unable to explain why the African countries should join the US boycott when it had failed to support the African boycott of the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] (in protest at [[Apartheid]] in South Africa), and was unaware that the [[Soviet Union]] was sponsoring popular revolutionary movements in Africa. Ali conceded "They didn't tell me about that in America", and complained that Carter had sent him "around the world to take the whupping over American policies."<ref name="Hauser 2004 p397">{{Harvnb|Hauser|2004|p=397}}</ref><ref>[https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/muhammad-ali-diplomat-213941 "Muhammad Ali’s Strange, Failed Diplomatic Career", by Michael Ezra, ''Politico Magazine'', June 5, 2016.

Muhammad Ali defeated every top heavyweight in his era, which has been called the golden age of heavyweight boxing. Ali was named "Fighter of the Year" by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine more times than any other fighter, and was involved in more ''Ring'' "Fight of the Year" bouts than any other fighter. He was an inductee into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] and held wins over seven other Hall of Fame inductees. He was one of only three boxers to be named "[[Sportsman of the Year]]" by ''Sports Illustrated''.

In 1978, three years before Ali's permanent retirement, the [[Louisville Board of Aldermen]] in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, voted 6–5 to rename Walnut Street to Muhammad Ali Boulevard. This was controversial at the time, as within a week 12 of the 70 street signs were stolen. Earlier that year, a committee of the [[Jefferson County Public Schools (Kentucky)|Jefferson County Public Schools]] (Kentucky) considered renaming Ali's alma mater, Central High School, in his honor, but the motion failed to pass. In time, Muhammad Ali Boulevard—and Ali himself—came to be well accepted in his hometown.<ref>{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Hill |title=Ali stirs conflicting emotions in hometown |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=November 19, 2005 |page=K5}}</ref>

In 1993, the Associated Press reported that Ali was tied with [[Babe Ruth]] as the most recognized athlete, out of over 800 dead or living athletes, in America. The study found that over 97% of Americans over 12 years of age identified both Ali and Ruth.<ref>Wilstein, Steve, Associated Press, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&dat=19930517&id=XZYxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RuEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1249,4781703 "Retton, Hammill most popular American athletes in United States: poll"]; ''The Daily Gazette'', May 17, 1993.</ref> He was the recipient of the 1997 [[Arthur Ashe Courage Award]].

On November 19, 2005 (Ali's 19th wedding anniversary), the $60{{nbsp}}million non-profit [[Muhammad Ali Center]] opened in downtown Louisville. In addition to displaying his boxing memorabilia, the center focuses on core themes of peace, social responsibility, respect, and personal growth.

[[Ali Mall]], located in [[Araneta Center]], Quezon City, Philippines, is named after him.

The [[Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act]] was introduced in 1999 and passed in 2000, to protect the rights and welfare of boxers in the United States.

In 2015, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' renamed its Sportsman Legacy Award to the ''Sports Illustrated'''s Muhammad Ali Legacy Award. The annual award was originally created in 2008 and honors former "sports figures who embody the ideals of sportsmanship, leadership and philanthropy as vehicles for changing the world." Ali first appeared on the magazine's cover in 1963 and went on to be featured on numerous covers during his storied career.<ref>[https://www.si.com/sports-illustrated-sportsman-year-legacy-award-renamed-for-muhammad-ali SI Wire] "SI dedicates Sportsman of the Year Legacy Award to Muhammad Ali", ''Sports Illustrated'', September 25, 2015.
