'''Orenthal James Simpson''' (born July 9, 1947), nicknamed "'''The Juice'''", is an American former [[American football|football]] [[running back]], broadcaster, actor, advertising spokesman, and convicted [[felon]]. Once a popular figure with the U.S. public, he is best known for [[O. J. Simpson murder case|being tried for the murders]] of his former wife, [[Nicole Brown Simpson]], and her friend, [[Ron Goldman]]. Simpson was acquitted of the murders in criminal court, but was later found responsible for both deaths in [[O. J. Simpson murder case#Civil trial|a civil trial]].

Simpson attended the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), where he played football for the [[USC Trojans football|USC Trojans]] and won the [[Heisman Trophy]] in 1968. He played professionally as a [[running back]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for 11 seasons, primarily with the [[Buffalo Bills]] from 1969 to 1977. He also played for the [[San Francisco 49ers]] from 1978 to 1979. In 1973, he became the first NFL player to [[Rush (gridiron football)|rush]] for more than [[2,000-yard club|2,000 yards]] in a season. He holds the record for the single season yards-per-game average, which stands at 143.1. He was the only player to ever rush for over 2,000 yards in the 14-game regular season NFL format. Simpson was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1983 and the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1985. After retiring from football, he began new careers in acting and football broadcasting.

In 1994, Simpson was arrested and charged with the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman. He was acquitted by a jury after a lengthy and internationally publicized trial. The families of the victims subsequently filed a civil suit against him. A [[Civil law (common law)|civil court]] awarded a $33.5 million judgment against him in 1997 for the victims' [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]]s. In 2000, he moved to [[Florida]] and settled in [[Miami]] to avoid paying any more of the liability judgment, which as of 2019 he has mostly not paid.

In 2007, Simpson was arrested in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and charged with the [[felonies]] of armed robbery and kidnapping.<ref name="arrest">{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/oj/nvoj91607arrstrpt.html |title=O.J.

==College football and athletics career==

Although Simpson was an All-City football player at Galileo, his mediocre high school grades prevented him from attracting the interest of many college recruiters. After a childhood friend's injury in the [[Vietnam War]] influenced Simpson to stay out of the military, he enrolled at [[City College of San Francisco]] in 1965.<ref name="cahill19770908">{{Cite magazine |last=Cahill |first=Tim |date=September 8, 1977 |title=O.J.

As a junior in 1967, Simpson was a close runner-up in the Heisman Trophy [[1967 college football season#Heisman Trophy|balloting]] to quarterback [[Gary Beban]] of [[1967 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]]. In [[1967 USC vs. UCLA football game|that year's]] [[Victory Bell (UCLA–USC)|Victory Bell]] rivalry game between the teams, USC was down by six points in the fourth quarter with under eleven minutes remaining. On their own 36, USC backup quarterback Toby Page called an audible on third and seven. Simpson's 64-yard touchdown run tied the score, and the [[extra point]] provided a 21–20 lead, which was the final score.<ref name=spbtrpbr>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jDlWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=G-kDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6952%2C1660834 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Simpson powers Trojans past Bruins into Rose Bowl |date=November 19, 1968 |page=1, sports}}</ref> This was the biggest play in what is regarded as one of the [[Game of the Century (college football)|greatest football games of the 20th century]].<ref>Peters, Nick.

The first selection [[1969 NFL/AFL Draft|1969 AFL–NFL Common Draft]] was held by the [[American Football League|AFL]]'s [[1969 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]], after finishing 1–12–1 in [[1968 Buffalo Bills season|1968]]. They took Simpson, but he demanded what was then the largest contract in professional sports history: [[United States dollar|$]]650,000 over five years. This led to a standoff with Bills' owner [[Ralph Wilson]], as Simpson threatened to become an actor and skip professional football. Eventually, Wilson agreed to pay Simpson.<ref name=Posnanski_2000>Posnanski, Joe. [http://sportsworld.nbcsports.com/oj-simpson-2000-yards/ Chasing 2,000 in '73]. NBCSports.com.

In a [[1974–75 NFL playoffs#AFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 32, Buffalo Bills 14|divisional game]] against the [[1974 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], Simpson rushed for 49 yards on 15 attempts and caught a touchdown pass, but the Bills lost the game 32–14.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SimpO.00/gamelog/post/ |title=O.J.

Simpson won the rushing title again in [[1975 Buffalo Bills season|1975]], rushing for 1,817 yards and 16 [[touchdown]]s.

A low light that season came during a game against the [[1976 New England Patriots|Patriots]] a few weeks earlier when defensive end Mel Lunsford and several other Patriots defenders stuffed the superstar running back for no gain but as Simpson tried to continue driving forward Lunsford bodyslammed him to the ground. Simpson got up and punched Lunsford which prompted Lunsford to swing back. Bills offensive lineman [[Reggie McKenzie (guard)|Reggie McKenzie]] then jumped on Lunsford's back but Lunsford bent down and flung McKenzie over his head and went back to swinging at Simpson before a melee of the two teams stopped the fight and ended up in a pile on the field. Lunsford and Simpson were both ejected from the game as the Patriots solid defense persisted with New England going on to win 20-10 on their way to finishing the 1976 season 11-3. The Bills finished 2-12.

Simpson played in only seven games in [[1977 Buffalo Bills season|1977]], as his season was cut short by injury.<ref name="charmed"/>

===Career summary===
Simpson gained 11,236 rushing yards, placing him 2nd on the [[List of National Football League rushing yards leaders|NFL's all-time rushing list]] when he retired; he now stands at 21st.

He was the only player in NFL history to rush for over 2,000 yards in a 14-game season and he is the only player to rush for over 200 yards in six different games in his career. From 1972 to 1976, Simpson averaged 1,540 rushing yards per (14 game) season, 5.1 yards per carry, and he won the [[NFL Annual Rushing Leaders|NFL rushing title]] four times.<ref name="stats" /> Simpson was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1985, his first year of eligibility.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brennan|first=Christine|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/brennan/2007-09-19-oj-hall_N.htm|title=Pro Football Hall needs O.J. exit strategy|date=September 19, 2007|publisher=usatoday.com|accessdate=May 15, 2013}}</ref> In 2019, he was named to the [[National Football League 100th Anniversary All-Time Team]].<ref name="RB">{{cite news |author=Battista, Judy |title=NFL's All-Time Team: Jim Brown tops RBs; Bill Belichick a coach |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001079453/article/nfls-alltime-team-jim-brown-tops-rbs-bill-belichick-a-coach |website=NFL.com |date=November 22, 2019 |accessdate=November 23, 2019}}</ref>

Simpson played in only one playoff game during his 11-season Hall of Fame career: a 1974 Divisional Playoff between the Buffalo Bills and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Simpson was held to 49 rushing yards, three receptions for 37 yards, and one touchdown, and the Bills lost 14–32 to the team which went on to win [[Super Bowl IX]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Simpson acquired the nickname "Juice" as a play on "O.J.", a common abbreviation for [[orange juice]]. "Juice" is also a colloquial synonym for electricity or electrical power, and hence a metaphor for any powerful entity; the Bills' offensive line at Simpson's peak was nicknamed "[[Electric Company (football)|The Electric Company]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalosportsdaily.com/2010/06/top-20-bills-all-time-draft-picks-joe-delamielleure-8/|title=Top 20 Bills All-Time Draft Picks: Joe DeLamielleure (#8)|accessdate=June 27, 2010|date=June 15, 2010|author=Moran, Patrick|work=Buffalo Sports Daily|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621020444/http://www.buffalosportsdaily.com/2010/06/top-20-bills-all-time-draft-picks-joe-delamielleure-8/<!-- Added by H3llBot -->|archivedate=June 21, 2010}}</ref>

==Acting career==
Simpson began acting before professional football, appearing in the first episode of ''[[Medical Center (TV series)|Medical Center]]'' while negotiating his contract with the Bills.{{r|carson19791219}} While in the NFL Simpson appeared in productions such as the television mini-series ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' (1977), and the dramatic motion pictures ''[[The Klansman]]'' (1974), ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974), ''[[The Cassandra Crossing]]'' (1976), and ''[[Capricorn One]]'' (1978). In 1979, he started his own film production company, Orenthal Productions, which dealt mostly in made-for-TV fare such as the family-oriented ''[[Goldie and the Boxer]]'' films with [[Melissa Michaelsen]] (1979 and 1981), and ''Cocaine and Blue Eyes'' (1983), the pilot for a proposed detective series on [[NBC]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Simpson said that he did not seriously consider an acting career until seeing [[Lee Marvin]] and [[Richard Burton]], while filming ''The Klansman'' in [[Oroville, California]], ordering chili from [[Chasen's]] via private jet.{{r|carson19791219}} He avoided starring in [[blaxploitation]] films, choosing third or fourth lead roles while studying experienced stars like Marvin and Burton.{{r|cahill19770908}} [[#Endorsements|The Hertz commercials from 1975]] benefited Simpson's acting career but he sometimes intentionally chose non-positive roles; "I've got to tear down that picture of O.J. Simpson, the clean-cut athlete, to get believability into whatever part I happen to be playing".{{r|crupi20160614}} Simpson also starred in the comedic ''[[Back to the Beach]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Naked Gun]]'' trilogy (1988, 1991, 1994). According to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], Simpson was considered by director [[James Cameron]] to play the [[Terminator (character)|eponymous character]] in ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) when Schwarzenegger was cast as [[Kyle Reese]], but Cameron ultimately cast Schwarzenegger as the Terminator while Simpson had no involvement in the film.

Besides his acting career, Simpson worked as a commentator for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' and ''[[The NFL on NBC]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of ABC's Monday Night Football|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/s/2003/0115/1493105.html|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=January 15, 2003|accessdate=March 15, 2008}}</ref> He also appeared in the audience of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' during its second season and hosted an episode during its third season.<ref>{{cite episode|title=OJ Simpson/Ashford & Simpson|url=http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episodes/Show_84.shtml|series=[[Saturday Night Live]]|airdate=1978-02-25|network=[[NBC]]|season=3|number=12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326163850/http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episodes/Show_84.shtml|archivedate=March 26, 2008}}</ref>

===''Frogmen''===

Simpson starred in the un-televised two-hour-long [[film pilot]] for ''Frogmen'', an ''[[The A-Team|A-Team]]''-like adventure series that [[Warner Bros. Television]] completed in 1994, a few months before the murders. NBC had not yet decided whether to order the series when Simpson's arrest cancelled the project. While searching his home, the police obtained a videotaped copy of the pilot as well as the script and [[dailies]]. Although the prosecution investigated reports that Simpson, who played the leader of a group of former [[United States Navy SEALs]], received "a fair amount of" military training—including use of a knife—for ''Frogmen'', and there is a scene in which he holds a knife to the throat of a woman, this material was not introduced as evidence during the trial.<ref name="lowry20000508">{{cite news | url=https://articles.latimes.com/print/2000/may/08/entertainment/ca-27673 | title=The Saga of O.J.'s Last, Lost Pilot | accessdate=April 5, 2011 | author=Lowry, Brian | date=May 8, 2000 |work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

NBC executive [[Warren Littlefield]] said in July 1994 that the network would probably never air the pilot if Simpson were convicted; if he were acquitted, however, one television journalist speculated that "''Frogmen'' would probably be on the air before the [[NBC peacock]] could unfurl its plume".<ref name="jicha19940727">{{cite news | url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-07-27/lifestyle/9407260286_1_littlefield-tv-movie-simpson-case | title=NBC May Bury Simpson TV Movie At Sea | work=Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel | date=July 27, 1994 | accessdate=April 24, 2014 | author=Jicha, Tom}}</ref> Most pilots that are two hours long are aired as [[TV movie]]s whether or not they are ordered as series. Because—as the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' later reported—"the appetite for all things O.J. appeared insatiable" during the trial, Warner Bros. and NBC estimated that a gigantic, [[Super Bowl]]-like television audience would have watched the ''Frogmen'' film. Co-star [[Evan Handler]] said the studio's decision not to air it or release it on home video, and forego an estimated $14&nbsp;million in profits, was "just about the only proof you have that there is some dignity in the advertising and television business".<ref name="lowry20000508"/>

===''Juiced''===

In 2006, Simpson starred in his own [[Improvisational theatre|improv]], hidden-camera prank TV show, ''Juiced''. Typical of the genre, Simpson would play a prank on everyday people while secretly filming them and at the end of each prank, he would shout, "You've been Juiced!" Less typical, each episode opened with topless strippers dancing around Simpson, who is dressed as a pimp. He sings his own rap song, which includes the lyrics "Don't you know there's no stopping the Juice / When I'm on the floor I'm like a lion on the loose / Better shoot me with a tranquilizer dart / Don't be stupid, I'm not a Simpson named Bart." In one episode, Simpson is at a used car lot in Las Vegas where he attempts to sell his white Bronco. A bullet hole in the front of the SUV is circled with his autograph, and he pitches it to a prospective buyer by saying that if they "ever get into some trouble and have to get away, it has escapability."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.com/13393604/remembering-oj-simpsons-bizarre-prank-tv-show |title=Remembering O.J. Simpson's Bizarre Prank TV Show |last=Stampler |first=Laura |date=January 29, 2016 |work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] |accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref> In another sketch called "B-I-N-G-O.J.", Simpson pretends to be having an affair with another man's girlfriend. Later he transforms into an old white man whose dying wish is to call a game of bingo. ''Juiced'' aired as a one-time special on pay-per-view television and was later released on DVD.<ref>{{cite web| last=Fallon| first=Kevin| title=Remember When O.J.

===Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman murders and trials===

{{main|O. J. Simpson murder case}}

====Criminal trial for murder====

[[File:Mug shot of O.J. Simpson.jpg|thumb|upright|Simpson's mugshot, June 17, 1994]]

On June 12, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and [[Ron Goldman]] were found stabbed to death outside Nicole's [[condo]] in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] area of Los Angeles. Simpson was a [[person of interest]] in their murders. Simpson did not turn himself in, and on June 17 he became the object of a low-speed pursuit by police while riding as a passenger in the white 1993 [[Ford Bronco]] [[SUV]] owned and driven by his longtime friend [[Al Cowlings]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/18/us/the-simpson-case-the-fugitive-simpson-is-charged-chased-arrested.html|title=The Fugitive: Simpson Is Charged, Chased, Arrested|last=Mydans|first=Seth|date=June 18, 1994|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=March 4, 2014}}</ref> TV stations interrupted coverage of the [[1994 NBA Finals]] to broadcast the incident live. With an estimated audience of 95 million people, the event was described as "the most famous ride on American shores since [[Paul Revere]]'s".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdbQMywnrdwC&pg=PA174&dq=Simpson+Bronco+most+famous+ride+since+Paul+Revere|title=Crimes of the century: from Leopold and Loeb to O.J.

The pursuit, arrest, and [[trial]] of Simpson were among the most widely publicized events in American history. The trial, often characterized as the [[Trial of the Century]] because of its international publicity, likened to that of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], culminated after eleven months on October 3, 1995, when the jury rendered a verdict of "not guilty" for the two murders. An estimated 100 million people nationwide tuned in to watch or listen to the verdict announcement.<ref name=dershowitz2004>{{cite book|title=America on trial: inside the legal battles that transformed our nation|last=Dershowitz|first=Alan M.|authorlink=Alan Dershowitz|isbn=0-446-52058-6|date=May 2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/americaontrialin00ders/page/514 514]|publisher=[[Warner Books]]|url=https://archive.org/details/americaontrialin00ders/page/514}}</ref> Following Simpson's acquittal, no additional arrests or convictions related to the murders were made.

Immediate reaction to the verdict was known for its division along racial lines: a poll of [[Los Angeles County]] residents showed that most African Americans there felt justice had been served by the "not guilty" verdict, while the majority of whites and Latinos opined that it had not.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Cathleen|title=THE TIMES POLL: Most in County Disagree With Simpson Verdicts|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-08/news/mn-54801_1_times-poll|access-date=January 16, 2015}}</ref> The black community was influenced by having suffered in Los Angeles from oppression by the majority-white, discriminatory police department. O. J. Simpson's integrated defense counsel team included [[Johnnie Cochran]], [[Robert Kardashian]], [[Robert Shapiro (lawyer)|Robert Shapiro]], and [[F. Lee Bailey]]. [[Marcia Clark]] was the lead prosecutor for the State of California.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Toobin|first1=Jeffrey|title=True Grit|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/01/09/true-grit|accessdate=October 24, 2016|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=January 9, 2016|page=28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/work/oj-simpson-prosecutor-his-murder-trial-ruined-my-life---but-20-y/|title=O.J.Simpson prosecutor: 'His murder trial ruined my life—but 20 years on I'm back'|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=March 18, 2016|access-date=October 24, 2016}}</ref>

According to a 2016 poll, 83% of white Americans and 57% of black Americans believe Simpson committed the murders.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/25/black-and-white-americans-can-now-agree-o-j-was-guilty/ |title=Two decades later, black and white Americans finally agree on O.J.

====Wrongful death civil trial====

Following Simpson's acquittal of criminal charges, Ron Goldman's family filed a civil lawsuit against Simpson. [[Daniel Petrocelli]] represented plaintiff Fred Goldman (Ronald Goldman's father), while Robert Baker represented Simpson.<ref name="Civil Case">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9609/16/simpson.case/|publisher=CNN|title=The O.J.

On February 5, 1997, a civil jury in [[Santa Monica, California]] unanimously found Simpson liable for the [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] of and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] against Goldman, and battery against Brown. Simpson was ordered to pay $33,500,000 in damages. In February 1999, an auction of Simpson's [[Heisman Trophy]] and other belongings netted almost $500,000, which went to the Goldman family.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,615340,00.html|magazine=People|title=O.J.'S Heisman Sold|date=April 22, 1999}}</ref>

The Goldman family also tried to collect Simpson's [[NFL]] $28,000 yearly pension<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/michael_mccann/09/18/hearings|publisher=CNN|title=No easy answers|date=September 18, 2007}}</ref> but failed to collect any money.<ref>{{cite news|title=Judge Rules Simpson's Mother Can Keep Piano|url=http://www.courttv.com/casefiles/simpson/ojsimpson.html|date=September 30, 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213051600/http://www.courttv.com/casefiles/simpson/ojsimpson.html|archivedate=February 13, 2008}}</ref>

In 1997, Simpson defaulted on his mortgage at the home in which he had lived for 20 years, at 360 North Rockingham Avenue, and the lender [[Foreclosure|foreclosed]] in the property. In July 1998, the house was demolished by its next owner, Kenneth Abdalla, an investment banker and president of the [[Jerry's Famous Deli]] chain.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Chicago Tribune|title=New Owner Demolishes O.J.

On September 5, 2006, Goldman's father took Simpson back to court to obtain control over Simpson's "right to publicity", for purposes of satisfying the judgment in the civil court case.<ref name="spending">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070305235730/http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/02/08/simpson.lawsuit.ap/index.html "O.J.

May 3, 2007.</ref> On January 4, 2007, a federal judge issued a [[restraining order]] prohibiting Simpson from spending any advance he may have received on a canceled book deal and TV interview about the 1994 murders. The matter was dismissed before trial for lack of jurisdiction.<ref name="spending" /> On January 19, 2007, a California state judge issued an additional restraining order, ordering Simpson to restrict his spending to "ordinary and necessary living expenses".<ref name="spending" />

On March 13, 2007, a judge prevented Simpson from receiving any further compensation from the defunct book deal and TV interview, and the judge ordered the bundled book rights to be auctioned.<ref>[http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/14/102934.shtml "Judge Keeps O.J.

The State of California claims Simpson owes $1.44&nbsp;million in [[back taxes]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN1733575520071018|title=O.J.

In the late 1990s, Simpson attempted to register "O. J. Simpson", "O. J.", and "The Juice" as trademarks for "a broad range of goods, including figurines, trading cards, sportswear, medallions, coins, and prepaid telephone cards".<ref>''Ritchie v. Simpson'', 170 F.3D 1092 (C.A.F.C., 1999)</ref> A "concerned citizen", William B. Ritchie, sued to oppose the granting of federal registration on the grounds that doing so would be immoral and scandalous. Simpson gave up the effort in 2000 and left California that year for [[Florida]], settling in [[Miami]]. Florida is one of few states where pensions and/or residences cannot generally be seized to collect debts.

In February 2001, Simpson was arrested in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]], for simple battery and burglary of an occupied conveyance, for yanking the glasses off another motorist during a traffic dispute three months earlier. If convicted, Simpson could have faced up to 16 years in prison, but he was tried and quickly acquitted of both charges in October 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/jury-clears-oj-simpson-of-roadrage-charges-632646.html|title= Jury clears O.J.

On December 4, 2001, Simpson's Miami home was searched by the FBI on suspicion of [[MDMA|ecstasy]] possession and [[money laundering]]. The FBI had received a tip that Simpson was involved in a major drug trafficking ring after 10 other suspects were arrested in the case. Simpson's home was thoroughly searched for two hours, but no illegal drugs were discovered, and no arrest or formal charges were filed following the search. However, investigators uncovered equipment capable of stealing satellite television programming, which eventually led to Simpson's being sued in federal court.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/06/06/national/main202915.shtml|title=O.J.

In March 2004, satellite television network [[DirecTV]], Inc. accused Simpson in a Miami federal court of using illegal electronic devices to [[piracy|pirate]] its broadcast signals. The company later won a $25,000 judgment, and Simpson was ordered to pay an additional $33,678 in attorney's fees and costs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8719276|title=O.J.

On November 8, 2007, Simpson had a preliminary hearing to decide whether he would be tried for the charges. He was held over for trial on all 12 counts. Simpson pleaded not guilty on November 29, and the trial was reset from April to September 8, 2008.<ref name="jurors">[http://www.newsmax.com/us/oj_simpson/2008/05/22/98327.html "400 jurors could be screened for OJ Simpson trial"].{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} ''Newsmax''.
