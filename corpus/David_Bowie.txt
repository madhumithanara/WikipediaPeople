'''David Robert Jones''' (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as '''David Bowie''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|i}} {{respell|BOH|ee|}}),<ref name="saybowe">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/magazinemonitor/2007/01/how_to_say_bowie.shtml|title=How to say: Bowie|accessdate=16 September 2010|publisher=BBC|date=8 January 2008 }}</ref> was an English singer-songwriter and actor. He was a leading figure in the music industry and is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. He was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on [[popular music]]. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]]. In the UK, he was awarded ten [[BPI certification|platinum]] album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and released [[List of artists by number of UK Albums Chart number ones|eleven number-one albums]]. In the US, he received five [[RIAA certification|platinum]] and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed him among its list of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]] and following his death in 2016, Bowie was dubbed "The Greatest Rock Star Ever" by the magazine.<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/thanks-starman-why-david-bowie-was-the-greatest-rock-star-ever-20160111|title=Why David Bowie Was the Greatest Rock Star Ever|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=13 February 2018}}</ref>

Born in [[Brixton]], [[South London]], Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. "[[Space Oddity]]" became his first top-five entry on the [[UK Singles Chart]] after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the [[glam rock]] era with his flamboyant and androgynous [[alter ego]] [[Ziggy Stardust (character)|Ziggy Stardust]]. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single "[[Starman (song)|Starman]]" and album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as "[[plastic soul]]", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single "[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]" and the album ''[[Young Americans]]''. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', directed by [[Nicolas Roeg]], and released ''[[Station to Station]]''. In 1977, he further confounded musical expectations with the [[electronic music|electronic]]-inflected album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', the first of three collaborations with [[Brian Eno]] that came to be known as the "[[Berlin Trilogy]]". ''[["Heroes" (David Bowie album)|"Heroes"]]'' (1977) and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.

After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single "[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]", its parent album ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)]]'', and "[[Under Pressure]]", a 1981 collaboration with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. He reached his commercial peak in 1983 with ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]''; the album's [[Let's Dance (David Bowie song)|title track]] topped both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[oldschool jungle|jungle]]. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'' (1983), [[Jareth]] the Goblin King in ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986), [[Pontius Pilate]] in ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), and [[Nikola Tesla]] in ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with ''[[The Next Day]].'' He remained musically active until his [[Death of David Bowie|death from liver cancer]] at his home in New York City, two days after his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]'' (2016).
==Early life==
Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in [[Brixton]], London. His mother, Margaret Mary "Peggy" (née Burns; 2 October 1913 – 2 April 2001),<ref name="bowiewonderworld.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.bowiewonderworld.com/faq.htm#p06|title=David Bowie FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions}}</ref><ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1256864.stm|title=Bowie mourns mother's death|date=2 April 2001|work=BBC News}}</ref> was born at [[Shorncliffe Army Camp]] near [[Cheriton, Kent|Cheriton]], [[Kent]].<ref>Gillman (1987) p.17 "[Peggy] was born in the hospital at Shorncliffe Camp [near Folkestone, Kent] on October 2nd, 1913."</ref> Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in [[Manchester]].<ref>Gillman (1987) p.15 "[Her father] Jimmy Burns's parents were poor Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester" p.16 "[Jimmy] had known [her mother] in Manchester. Her name was Margaret Heaton"</ref> She worked as a waitress at a cinema in [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]].<ref>Gillman (1987) p. 44 "At the end of the war, Peggy Burns was working as a waitress at the Ritz cinema in Tunbridge Wells"</ref> His father, Haywood Stenton "John" Jones (21 November 1912 – 5 August 1969),<ref name="bowiewonderworld.com"/><ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> was from [[Doncaster]], [[Yorkshire]]<ref>Gillman (1987) p. 44 "John Jones was born in the grimy Yorkshire town of Doncaster in 1912."</ref> and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity [[Barnardo's]]. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and [[Stockwell]] in the south London borough of [[Lambeth]]. Bowie attended [[Stockwell Primary School|Stockwell Infants School]] until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 9–16</ref>

From 1953 Bowie moved with his family to [[Bickley]] and then [[Bromley Common]], before settling in [[Sundridge Park]] in 1955 where he attended Burnt Ash Junior School.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=Jim |title=18 south east London places where David Bowie lived, learned and played |url=https://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/14195175.map-18-south-east-london-places-where-david-bowie-lived-learned-and-played/ |website=News Shopper |date=11 January 2016|accessdate=31 August 2020}}</ref> His voice was considered "adequate" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]].<ref name="sandford18-19">Sandford (1997): pp. 18–19</ref> At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations "vividly artistic" and his poise "astonishing" for a child.<ref name="sandford18-19"/> The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American [[Gramophone record|45s]] by artists including [[the Teenagers]], [[the Platters]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[Little Richard]].<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 21.</ref><ref name="sandford19-20" /> Upon listening to Little Richard's song "[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]", Bowie would later say that he had "heard God".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Doggett|first=Peter|title=Teenage Wildlife|journal=Mojo Classic|issue=60 Years of Bowie|pages=8–9|date=January 2007}}</ref>

Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to "[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]".<ref name="sandford19-20">Sandford (1997): pp. 19–20</ref> By the end of the following year, Bowie had taken up the [[ukulele]] and [[tea-chest bass]], begun to participate in [[skiffle]] sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and [[Chuck Berry]]—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local [[Cub Scout|Wolf Cub]] group was described as "mesmerizing&nbsp;... like someone from another planet".<ref name="sandford19-20" /> After taking his [[eleven-plus]] exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to [[Ravens Wood School|Bromley Technical High School]].<ref name="bromleytech"/>

It was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford wrote:

{{quote|Despite its status it was, by the time David arrived in 1958, as rich in arcane ritual as any [English] [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public school]]. There were [[House system|houses]] named after eighteenth-century statesmen like [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt]] and [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce]]. There was a uniform, and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments. There was also an accent on languages, science and particularly design, where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of [[Owen Frampton]]. In David's account, Frampton led through force of personality, not intellect; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither, and yielded the school's most gifted pupils to the arts, a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son, [[Peter Frampton|Peter]], to pursue a musical career with David, a partnership briefly intact thirty years later.<ref name="bromleytech">Sandford (1997): pp. 21–22</ref>}}

Bowie studied art, music, and design, including layout and typesetting. After his older half-brother Terry Burns introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like [[Charles Mingus]] and [[John Coltrane]] led his mother to give him a [[Grafton saxophone]] in 1961. He was soon receiving lessons from [[baritone saxophone|baritone saxophonist]] [[Ronnie Ross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.berklee.edu/commencement/past|title=Commencement 1999 - Berklee College of Music|website=www.berklee.edu|accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref><ref>Sandford (1997): p. 25</ref> He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend [[George Underwood (artist)|George Underwood]] punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl.

==Music career==
{{Main|David Bowie discography}}

===1962–1967: Early career to debut album===
[[File:David Bowie (1967).png|thumb|upright|alt=Bowie looking to the camera|A trade ad photo of Bowie in 1967]]
Bowie formed his first band, the Konrads, in 1962 at the age of 15. Playing guitar-based [[rock and roll]] at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them.<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 28</ref> When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother arranged his employment as an electrician's mate. Frustrated by his bandmates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur [[John Bloom (businessman)|John Bloom]] inviting him to "do for us what [[Brian Epstein]] has done for [[the Beatles]]—and make another million." Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to [[Dick James]]'s partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.<ref name="sandford29-30">Sandford (1997): pp. 29–30</ref>

Conn quickly began to promote Bowie. The singer's debut single, "[[Liza Jane (David Bowie song)|Liza Jane]]", credited to Davie Jones with the King Bees, was not commercially successful. Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Willie Dixon]] covers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul—"I used to dream of being their [[Mick Jagger]]", Bowie was to recall.<ref name="sandford29-30" /> Their cover of [[Bobby Bland]]'s "[[I Pity the Fool]]" was no more successful than "Liza Jane", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by [[The Who]]. "[[You've Got a Habit of Leaving]]" fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop music world "to study mime at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]]", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, soon witnessed Bowie's move to yet another group, the Buzz, yielding the singer's fifth unsuccessful single release, "[[Do Anything You Say]]". While with the Buzz, Bowie also joined the [[The Riot Squad|Riot Squad]]; their recordings, which included one of Bowie's original songs and material by [[The Velvet Underground]], went unreleased. [[Kenneth Pitt]], introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager.<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 35–39</ref>

Dissatisfied with his stage name as Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] of [[The Monkees]], Bowie renamed himself after the 19th-century American pioneer [[James Bowie]] and [[Bowie knife|the knife he had popularised]].<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 33</ref> His April 1967 solo single, "[[The Laughing Gnome]]", using speeded-up thus high-pitched vocals, failed to chart. Released six weeks later, his album debut, ''[[David Bowie (1967 album)|David Bowie]]'', an amalgam of pop, [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]], and [[music hall]], met the same fate. It was his last release for two years.<ref name="albumdebut" />

=== 1968–1971: ''Space Oddity'' to ''Hunky Dory'' ===
{{anchor|Hermione Farthingale}}

Studying the dramatic arts under [[Lindsay Kemp]], from [[avant-garde]] theatre and [[mime artist|mime]] to [[commedia dell'arte]], Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, the Bowie composition "Over the Wall We Go" became a 1967 single for [[Paul Nicholas|Oscar]]; another Bowie song, "Silly Boy Blue", was released by [[Billy Fury]] the following year.<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 46</ref> Playing acoustic guitar, [[Hermione Farthingale]] formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson named Feathers; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, [[Beat music|Merseybeat]], poetry, and mime.<ref>Buckley (2005): pp. 49–52</ref> 

After the break-up with Farthingale, Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan as her lodger.<ref name="sandford53">Sandford (1997): p. 53</ref> In February and March 1969, he undertook a short tour with [[Marc Bolan]]'s duo [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]], as third on the bill, performing a mime act.<ref name="Paytress2009">{{cite book|first=Mark|last=Paytress|title=Bolan: The Rise and Fall of a 20th Century Superstar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-yk4U2LILeMC&pg=PT199|publisher=Omnibus Press|location=London, England|date=5 November 2009|isbn=978-0-85712-023-6|page=199}}</ref> On 11 July 1969, "Space Oddity" was released five days ahead of the [[Apollo 11]] launch, and reached the top five in the UK.<ref name="sandford49-50" /> Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale, Bowie joined forces with Finnigan, Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in [[Beckenham]] High Street.<ref name="sandford53" /> The club was influenced by the [[Arts Lab]] movement, developing into the [[Beckenham Arts Lab]] and became extremely popular. The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park, the subject of his song "[[Memory of a Free Festival]]".<ref>{{cite book|first=George|last=McKay|title=Senseless Acts of Beauty: Cultures of Resistance|publisher=[[Verso]]|location=Miamisburg, Ohio|year=1996|isbn=978-1-85984-908-8|page=188}}</ref>

Bowie's second album followed in November; originally issued in the UK as ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'', it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name, and the early US release was instead titled ''Man of Words/Man of Music''; it was reissued internationally in 1972 by [[RCA Records]] as ''Space Oddity''. Featuring philosophical post-[[hippie]] lyrics on peace, love, and morality, its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock, the album was not a commercial success at the time of its release.<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 60</ref>

Bowie met [[Angie Bowie|Angela Barnett]] in April 1969. They married within a year. Her impact on him was immediate, and her involvement in his career far-reaching, leaving manager Ken Pitt with limited influence which he found frustrating.<ref name="sandford54-60">Sandford (1997): pp. 54–60</ref> Having established himself as a solo artist with "Space Oddity", Bowie began to sense a lacking: "a full-time band for gigs and recording—people he could relate to personally".<ref name="sandford62-63" /> The shortcoming was underlined by his artistic rivalry with [[Marc Bolan]], who was at the time acting as his session guitarist.<ref name="sandford62-63">Sandford (1997): pp. 62–63</ref> The band Bowie assembled comprised John Cambridge, a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab, [[Tony Visconti]] on bass and [[Mick Ronson]] on electric guitar. Known as [[Hype (David Bowie band)|Hype]], the bandmates created characters for themselves and wore elaborate costumes that prefigured the glam style of the Spiders from Mars. After a disastrous opening gig at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|London Roundhouse]], they reverted to a configuration presenting Bowie as a solo artist.<ref name="sandford62-63" /><ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 89–90</ref> Their initial studio work was marred by a heated disagreement between Bowie and Cambridge over the latter's drumming style. Matters came to a head when an enraged Bowie accused the drummer of the disturbance, exclaiming "You're fucking up my album." Cambridge left and was replaced by [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name="sandford67">Sandford (1997): p. 67</ref> Not long after, the singer fired his manager and replaced him with [[Tony Defries]]. This resulted in years of litigation that concluded with Bowie having to pay Pitt compensation.<ref name="sandford67" />

The studio sessions continued and resulted in Bowie's third album, ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' (1970), which contained references to [[schizophrenia]], paranoia, and delusion.<ref>{{cite web|first=Karl|last=Smith|title=Random Ultra-Violence: Simon Critchley On David Bowie|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/16414-david-bowie-simon-critchley-biography-extract-2|work=The Quietus|location=London, England|date=6 October 2014|accessdate=14 December 2014}}</ref> Characterised by the heavy rock sound of his new [[Backup band|backing band]], it was a marked departure from the acoustic guitar and folk rock style established by ''Space Oddity''. To promote it in the US, [[Mercury Records]] financed a coast-to-coast publicity tour across America in which Bowie, between January and February 1971, was interviewed by radio stations and the media. Exploiting his [[androgyny|androgynous]] appearance, the original cover of the UK version unveiled two months later depicted the singer wearing a dress: taking the garment with him, he wore it during interviews—to the approval of critics, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[John Mendelsohn (musician)|John Mendelsohn]] who described him as "ravishing, almost disconcertingly reminiscent of [[Lauren Bacall]]"&nbsp;– and in the street, to mixed reaction including laughter and, in the case of one male pedestrian, producing a gun and telling Bowie to "kiss my ass".<ref name="sandford73-74">Sandford (1997): pp. 73–74</ref><ref>Pegg (2000): pp. 260–65</ref>

During the tour, Bowie's observation of two seminal American [[proto-punk]] artists led him to develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust character: a melding of the persona of [[Iggy Pop]] with the music of [[Lou Reed]], producing "the ultimate pop idol".<ref name="sandford73-74" /> A girlfriend recalled his "scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy", and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character "who looks like he's landed from Mars".<ref name="sandford73-74" /> The "Stardust" surname was a tribute to the "[[Legendary Stardust Cowboy]]", whose record he was given during the tour. Bowie would later cover "I Took a Trip on a Gemini Space Ship" on 2002's ''[[Heathen (David Bowie album)|Heathen]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=177}}

''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971) found Visconti, Bowie's producer and bassist, supplanted in both roles by [[Ken Scott]] and [[Trevor Bolder]] respectively. The album saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of "Space Oddity", with light fare such as "[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]", a song written for his son, [[Duncan Jones|Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones]], born on 30 May.<ref name="buckley95-99">Buckley (2005): pp. 95–99</ref> (His parents chose "his kooky name"—he was known as Zowie for the next 12 years—after the Greek word ''zoe'', life.)<ref name="sandford80">Sandford (1997): p. 80</ref> Elsewhere, the album explored more serious subjects, and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with "[[Song for Bob Dylan]]", "[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]", and "[[Queen Bitch]]", the latter a [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] pastiche. It was not a significant commercial success at the time.<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 85–86</ref>

===1972–1974: ''Ziggy Stardust''{{anchor|Ziggy Stardust}}===
[[File:David-Bowie Early.jpg|thumb|upright|Bowie during the [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]], 1972–1973]]
Dressed in a striking costume, his hair dyed reddish-brown, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with [[the Spiders from Mars]]—Ronson, Bolder, and Woodmansey—at the Toby Jug pub in [[Tolworth]] in [[Kingston upon Thames]] on 10 February 1972.<ref name="buckley135-6" /> The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating, as described by Buckley, a "cult of Bowie" that was "unique—its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom."<ref name="buckley135-6">Buckley (2005): pp. 135–36</ref> ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972), combining the hard rock elements of ''The Man Who Sold the World'' with the lighter experimental rock and pop of ''Hunky Dory'', was released in June. "[[Starman (song)|Starman]]", issued as an April single ahead of the album, was to cement Bowie's UK breakthrough: both single and album charted rapidly following his July ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' performance of the song. The album, which remained in the chart for two years, was soon joined there by the 6-month-old ''Hunky Dory''.

Described by Bowie as "Ziggy goes to America", it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the US during the earlier part of the Ziggy tour, which now continued to Japan to promote the new album. ''Aladdin Sane'' spawned the UK top five singles "[[The Jean Genie]]" and "[[Drive-In Saturday]]".<ref>Pegg (2004): pp. 281–83</ref><ref>Sandford (1997): p. 108</ref>

Bowie's love of acting led his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. "Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David." With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust—and later, the Thin White Duke—from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, "wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour&nbsp;... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity."<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 106–07</ref> His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both ''Ziggy Stardust'' and ''Aladdin Sane'', were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a [[sumo]] wrestling loincloth or simulating [[oral sex]] with Ronson's guitar.<ref name="Bowie: An Illustrated Record p.7">Carr & Murray (1981): p. 7</ref> Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage "retirement" at London's [[Hammersmith Odeon]] on 3 July 1973. Footage from the final show was released the same year for the film ''[[Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (film)|Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 116</ref>

After breaking up the Spiders from Mars, Bowie attempted to move on from his Ziggy persona. His back catalogue was now highly sought after: ''The Man Who Sold the World'' had been re-released in 1972 along with ''Space Oddity''. "[[Life on Mars?]]", from ''Hunky Dory'', was released in June 1973 and peaked at No. 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Entering the same chart in September, Bowie's novelty record from 1967, "[[The Laughing Gnome]]", reached No. 6.<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 163</ref> ''[[Pin Ups]]'', a collection of covers of his 1960s favourites, followed in October, producing a UK No. 3 hit in his version of [[the McCoys]]'s "[[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]" and itself peaking at number one, making David Bowie the best-selling act of 1973 in the UK. It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six.<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 115</ref>

===1974–1976: "Plastic soul" and the Thin White Duke===
[[File:David Bowie - TopPop 1974 08.png|thumb|185px|Bowie filming a video for "[[Rebel Rebel]]" in 1974|left]]
Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles.<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 3</ref> ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1974), parts of which found him heading towards [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]], was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-[[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] city, and setting [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'' to music.<ref>Buckley (2005): pp. 180–83</ref> The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits "[[Rebel Rebel]]" and "[[Diamond Dogs (song)|Diamond Dogs]]", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the [[Diamond Dogs Tour]], visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by [[Toni Basil]], and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by [[Alan Yentob]]. The resulting documentary, ''[[Cracked Actor]]'', featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy [[cocaine]] use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, [[paranoia]], and emotional problems.<ref name="buckley 204-5">Buckley (2005): pp. 204–5</ref> He later commented that the accompanying live album, ''[[David Live]]'', ought to have been titled "David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Allan |title=Goodbye to Ziggy and All That... |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ByCzBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=%22god,+that+album!+i%27ve+never+played+it%22&source=bl&ots=dgghrX-Xy_&sig=GzZoLpuBXtCGRCvQRslcTC4xz1Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPwbn8nKLKAhXBbT4KHSRPDQ4Q6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=%22god%2C%20that%20album!%20i've%20never%20played%20it%22&f=false |website=Melody Maker |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref> ''David Live'' nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of [[Eddie Floyd]]'s "[[Knock on Wood (song)|Knock on Wood]]". After a break in [[Philadelphia]], where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul.<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 128</ref>
[[File:Bowie-DD-1974-3.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bowie performing during [[Diamond Dogs Tour]], 1974]]
The fruit of the Philadelphia recording sessions was ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]'' (1975). Biographer Christopher Sandford writes, "Over the years, most British rockers had tried, one way or another, to become black-by-extension. Few had succeeded as Bowie did now."<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 138</ref> The album's sound, which the singer identified as "[[plastic soul]]", constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): pp. 68–74</ref> ''Young Americans'' yielded Bowie's first US number one, "[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]", co-written with [[John Lennon]], who contributed backing vocals, and [[Carlos Alomar]]. Lennon called Bowie's work "great, but it's just rock'n'roll with lipstick on".<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Buckley|editor-first=Peter|year=2003|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock0003unse/page/130 130]|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-105-0|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock0003unse/page/130}}</ref> Earning the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the US variety show ''[[Soul Train]]'', Bowie mimed "Fame", as well as "[[Golden Years (song)|Golden Years]]", his November single,<ref name="sandfordoctobersingle">Sandford (1997): p. 146</ref> which was originally offered to [[Elvis Presley]], who declined it.<ref name="sandfordoctobersingle"/> ''Young Americans'' was a commercial success in both the US and the UK, and a re-issue of the 1969 single "Space Oddity" became Bowie's first number-one hit in the UK a few months after "Fame" achieved the same in the US.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=David (ed.)|year=2001|publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd|title=Guinness World Records: British Hit Singles|isbn=978-0-85156-156-1|page=120}}</ref> Despite his by now well established superstardom, Bowie, in the words of Sandford, "for all his record sales (over a million copies of ''Ziggy Stardust'' alone), existed essentially on loose change."<ref name="firesDefries">Sandford (1997): pp. 135–36</ref> In 1975, in a move echoing Ken Pitt's acrimonious dismissal five years earlier, Bowie fired his manager. At the culmination of the ensuing months-long legal dispute, he watched, as described by Sandford, "millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered" in what were "uniquely generous terms for Defries", then "shut himself up in West 20th Street, where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door."<ref name="firesDefries" /> Michael Lippman, Bowie's lawyer during the negotiations, became his new manager; Lippman in turn was awarded substantial compensation when Bowie fired him the following year.<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 137, 153</ref>
[[File:David Bowie and Cher 1975.JPG|thumb|left|Bowie performing with [[Cher]] on the variety show ''[[Cher (TV series)|Cher]]'', 1975]]

''[[Station to Station]]'' (1976), produced by Bowie and Harry Maslin,<ref>{{cite news |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on ‘Station to Station’ |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |accessdate=23 December 2019 |work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> introduced a new Bowie persona, "[[The Thin White Duke]]" of its title-track. Visually, the character was an extension of Thomas Jerome Newton, the extraterrestrial being he portrayed in the film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'' the same year.<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 238</ref> Developing the funk and soul of ''Young Americans'', ''Station to Station'''s synthesizer-heavy arrangements prefigured the [[krautrock]]-influenced music of his next releases. The extent to which drug addiction was now affecting Bowie was made public when [[Russell Harty]] interviewed the singer for his [[London Weekend Television]] talk show in anticipation of the album's supporting tour. Shortly before the satellite-linked interview was scheduled to commence, the death of the Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] was announced. Bowie was asked to relinquish the satellite booking, to allow the Spanish Government to put out a live newsfeed. This he refused to do, and his interview went ahead. In the ensuing lengthy conversation with Harty, Bowie was incoherent and looked "disconnected".<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 244</ref> His sanity—by his own later admission—had become twisted from cocaine; he overdosed several times during the year, and was withering physically to an alarming degree.<ref name="buckley 204-5" /><ref name="sandford158" />

''Station to Station''{{'}}s January 1976 release was followed in February by a 3{{sfrac|1|2}}-month-long concert tour of Europe and North America. Featuring a starkly lit set, the [[Isolar – 1976 Tour]] with its colour newsprint Isolar concert program, highlighted songs from the album, including the dramatic and lengthy [[Station to Station (song)|title track]], the ballads "[[Wild Is the Wind (song)|Wild Is the Wind]]" and "[[Word on a Wing]]", and the funkier "[[TVC 15]]" and "[[Stay (David Bowie song)|Stay]]". The core band that coalesced to record this album and tour—rhythm guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]], bassist [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]], and drummer [[Dennis Davis]]—continued as a stable unit for the remainder of the 1970s. The tour was highly successful but mired in political controversy. Bowie was quoted in [[Stockholm]] as saying that "Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader", and was detained by customs on the Russian/Polish border for possessing [[Nazism|Nazi]] paraphernalia.<ref name="Buckley pp.289–91">Buckley (2000): pp. 289–91.</ref>
[[File:David Bowie 1976.jpg|thumb|Bowie as the Thin White Duke at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], Toronto, 1976]]
Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the "[[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] incident". Arriving in an open-top [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] [[convertible]], Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a [[Nazi salute]], which was captured on camera and published in ''[[NME]]''. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paytress|first=Mark|title=The Controversial Homecoming|journal=Mojo Classic|date=January 2007|issue=60 Years of Bowie|page=64}}</ref> He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 11</ref> "I was out of my mind, totally crazed.

He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs."<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 252</ref> Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had motivated these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with ''NME'', Bowie explained that Los Angeles was "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is."<ref>{{cite news|first=Angus|last=MacKinnon|title=The future isn't what it used to be David Bowie talks about loneliness, insecurity, and myth, And the dangers of messing with Major Tom|url=http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/articles/800913-nme.html|work=[[NME]]|location=London, England|date=13 September 1980|accessdate=30 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106013020/http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/articles/800913-nme.html|archive-date=6 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Hauptstraße 155 Berlin-Schöneberg.jpg|thumb|Apartment building at 155, Hauptstraße, [[Schöneberg]], Berlin, where Bowie lived from 1976 to 1978]]
Before the end of 1976, Bowie's interest in the burgeoning German music scene, as well as his drug addiction, prompted him to move to [[West Berlin]] to clean up and revitalise his career. There he was often seen riding a bicycle between his apartment on Hauptstraße in [[Schöneberg]] and [[Hansa Tonstudio]], the recording studio he used, located on Köthener Straße in [[Kreuzberg]], near the [[Berlin Wall]].<ref name="Ruether 82–85">{{cite web|first=Tobias|last=Ruether|url=https://032c.com/the-man-who-came-from-hell/|title=The Man Who Came from Hell|work=[[032c]]|pages=82–85|date=Winter 2006–2007|accessdate=21 July 2014}}</ref> While working with [[Brian Eno]] and sharing an apartment with Iggy Pop, he began to focus on minimalist, ambient music for the first of three albums, co-produced with [[Tony Visconti]], that became known as his [[Berlin Trilogy]].<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 149</ref> During the same period, Iggy Pop, with Bowie as a co-writer and musician, completed his solo album debut ''[[The Idiot (album)|The Idiot]]'' and its follow-up ''[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop album)|Lust for Life]]'', touring the UK, Europe, and the US in March and April 1977.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kris |last=Needs |title= The Passenger |work= [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo Classic]] |location= London, England |issue= "60 Years of Bowie" |page=65 |date= January 2007}}</ref>

The album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' (1977), partly influenced by the [[Krautrock]] sound of [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Neu!]], evinced a move away from narration in Bowie's songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional. Although he completed the album in November 1976, it took his unsettled record company another three months to release it.<ref name="Ruether 82–85"/> It received considerable negative criticism upon its release—a release which RCA, anxious to maintain the established commercial momentum, did not welcome,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PGoauc9eLBYC&pg=PT278#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=278|title=On Some Faraway Beach: The Life and Times of Brian Eno|author= David Sheppard|publisher=Hachette UK|date= 18 Sep 2008}}</ref> and which Bowie's former manager, Tony Defries, who still maintained a significant financial interest in the singer's affairs, tried to prevent.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicholas Pegg|title=The Complete David Bowie|publisher=Reynolds & Hearn|date=2006|page=309}}</ref> Despite these forebodings, ''Low'' yielded the UK No. 3 single "[[Sound and Vision]]", and its own performance surpassed that of ''Station to Station'' in the UK chart, where it reached No. 2. Contemporary composer [[Philip Glass]] described ''Low'' as "a work of genius" in 1992, when he used it as the basis for his ''[[Symphony No. 1 (Glass)|Symphony No. 1 "Low"]]''; subsequently, Glass used Bowie's next album as the basis for his 1996 ''[[Symphony No. 4 (Glass)|Symphony No. 4 "Heroes"]]''.<ref name="low">Sandford (1997): pp. 166–68</ref><ref>Perone (2007): p. 175</ref> Glass has praised Bowie's gift for creating "fairly complex pieces of music, masquerading as simple pieces".<ref>Thomson (1993): p. xiii</ref> Also in 1977, [[London Records|London]] released ''Starting Point'', a ten-song LP containing releases from Bowie's [[Deram Records|Deram]] period (1966—67).<ref>{{cite web|first=Alex|last=Henderson|title=Starting Point – David Bowie|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/starting-point-mw0000312210|website=AllMusic|accessdate=9 January 2018}}</ref>

{{Listen|filename=David Bowie - Heroes.ogg|title="Heroes"|description=Sample of "[["Heroes" (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]" (1977). One of the ambient rock songs to emerge from Bowie's [[Berlin Trilogy]] era, "Heroes" gained lasting popularity.}}
Echoing ''Low''{{'}}s minimalist, instrumental approach, the second of the trilogy, ''[["Heroes" (David Bowie album)|"Heroes"]]'' (1977), incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent, seeing Bowie joined by guitarist [[Robert Fripp]]. Like ''Low'', ''"Heroes"'' evinced the [[zeitgeist]] of the [[Cold War]], symbolised by the divided city of Berlin.<ref>Pegg (2000): pp. 90–92</ref> Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators, synthesisers and [[Koto (instrument)|koto]], the album was another hit, reaching No. 3 in the UK. Its [["Heroes" (song)|title-track]], though only reaching No. 24 in the UK singles chart, gained lasting popularity, and within months had been released in both German and French.<ref name="heroes">Sandford (1997): pp. 181–82</ref> Towards the end of the year, Bowie performed the song for Marc Bolan's television show ''[[Marc (TV series)|Marc]]'', and again two days later for [[Bing Crosby]]'s final [[CBS]] television Christmas special, when he joined Crosby in "[[Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy]]", a version of "[[The Little Drummer Boy]]" with a new, [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] verse. Five years later, the duet proved a worldwide seasonal hit, charting in the UK at No. 3 on Christmas Day, 1982.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|title=The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits|year=1990|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=978-0-8230-7677-2|page=572}}</ref>

After completing ''Low'' and ''"Heroes"'', Bowie spent much of 1978 on the [[Isolar II – The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II world tour]], bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By now he had broken his drug addiction; biographer David Buckley writes that Isolar II was "Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage.&nbsp;... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends."<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 293</ref> Recordings from the tour made up the live album ''[[Stage (David Bowie album)|Stage]]'', released the same year.<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 189</ref> Bowie also recorded narration for an adaptation of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s classical composition ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', which was released as an [[David Bowie Narrates Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf|album]] in May 1978.<ref>{{cite web |title=David Bowie Narrates Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/david-bowie-narrates-prokofievs-peter-and-the-wolf-mw0001375571 |website=Allmusic |accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref>

The final piece in what Bowie called his "[[triptych]]", ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1979), eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of the other two, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. The result was a complex mixture of [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[world music]], in places incorporating [[Phrygian dominant scale|Hijaz]] [[Musical scale#Non-Western scales|non-Western scales]]. Some tracks were composed using Eno and [[Peter Schmidt (artist)|Peter Schmidt]]'s [[Oblique Strategies]] cards: "Boys Keep Swinging" entailed band members swapping instruments, "Move On" used the chords from Bowie's early composition "All the Young Dudes" played backwards, and "Red Money" took backing tracks from "Sister Midnight", a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): pp. 102–07</ref> The album was recorded in Switzerland. Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman stated, "It would be fair to call it Bowie's ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sergeant Pepper]]''&nbsp;... a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology." As described by biographer Christopher Sandford, "The record dashed such high hopes with dubious choices, and production that spelt the end—for fifteen years—of Bowie's partnership with Eno." ''Lodger'' reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles "[[Boys Keep Swinging]]" and "[[DJ (David Bowie song)|DJ]]".<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 281</ref><ref name="lodger">Sandford (1997): pp. 191–92</ref> Towards the end of the year, Bowie and Angie initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980.<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 197</ref>

===1980–1988: New Romantic and pop era===
[[File:Bowie 1983 serious moonlight.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Serious Moonlight Tour]], 1983]]
''[[Scary Monsters and Super Creeps]]'' (1980) produced the number-one hit "[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist [[Chuck Hammer]] and revisiting the character of Major Tom from "Space Oddity". The song gave international exposure to the underground [[New Romantic]] movement when Bowie visited the London club "Blitz"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including [[Steve Strange]] of the band [[Visage (band)|Visage]]) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time.<ref>Pegg (2000): p. 29</ref> While ''Scary Monsters'' used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from [[Robert Fripp]], [[Chuck Hammer]], and [[Pete Townshend]].<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): pp. 108–14</ref> As "Ashes to Ashes" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as [[Joseph Merrick|John Merrick]] in ''[[The Elephant Man (play)|The Elephant Man]]''.<ref name="elephantman">Sandford (1997): pp. 205–07</ref>

Bowie paired with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1981 for a one-off single release, "[[Under Pressure]]". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single.<ref>{{cite news |title=David Bowie: UK Chart history |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/19138/david-bowie/ |accessdate=19 March 2020 |agency=Official Charts Company}}</ref> Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s play ''[[Baal (play)|Baal]]''. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track [[Extended play|EP]] of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as ''[[Baal (EP)|David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal]]''. In March 1982, the month before [[Paul Schrader]]'s film ''[[Cat People (1982 film)|Cat People]]'' came out, Bowie's title song, "[[Cat People (Putting Out Fire)]]", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 208, 211–12</ref>

Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]''.<ref>{{cite news | first=Mick | last=Brown| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/david-bowie-interview-from-1996-i-have-done-just-about-everythin/ | title= David Bowie interview from 1996: 'I have done just about everything that it's possible to do' | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London, England | date=11 January 2016 | accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref> Co-produced by [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s [[Nile Rodgers]], the album went platinum in both the UK and the US.

"[[Modern Love (song)|Modern Love]]" and "[[China Girl (song)|China Girl]]" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of "absorbing" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said "activated key archetypes in the pop world. 'Let's Dance', with its little narrative surrounding the young [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigine]] couple, targeted 'youth', and 'China Girl', with its bare-bummed (and later partially censored) beach lovemaking scene (a homage to the film ''[[From Here to Eternity]]''), was sufficiently sexually provocative to guarantee heavy rotation on MTV".<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 344.</ref> [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] was guest guitarist playing solo on "Let's Dance", although the video depicts Bowie miming this part.<ref>{{cite news |first=Timothy|last=White |title=David Bowie Interview |work=Musician|date=May 1983|volume=55 |pages=52–66, 122}}</ref> By 1983, Bowie had emerged as one of the most important video artists of the day. ''Let's Dance'' was followed by the [[Serious Moonlight Tour]], during which Bowie was accompanied by guitarist [[Earl Slick]] and backing vocalists Frank and George Simms.

''[[Tonight (David Bowie album)|Tonight]]'' (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with [[Tina Turner]] and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]] hit "[[God Only Knows]]". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit "[[Blue Jean (song)|Blue Jean]]", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video]], ''[[Jazzin' for Blue Jean]]''. Bowie performed at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in 1985 for [[Live Aid]], a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-david-bowie-triumphs-at-live-aid-in-1985-20160126 | title= Flashback: David Bowie Triumphs at Live Aid in 1985 | work=Rolling Stone | first=Andy | last=Greene | date=26 January 2016 | accessdate=5 May 2018}}</ref> During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with [[Mick Jagger]]. "[[Dancing in the Street]]" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the [[Pat Metheny Group]] to record "[[This Is Not America]]" for the soundtrack of ''[[The Falcon and the Snowman]]''. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.<ref>Buckley (2005): pp. 165–66</ref>

Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]''. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's [[Theme music|theme song]], also named "[[Absolute Beginners (David Bowie song)|Absolute Beginners]]", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as [[Jareth]], the Goblin King, in the 1986 [[Jim Henson]] film ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'', for which he worked with composer [[Trevor Jones (composer)|Trevor Jones]] and wrote five original songs.<ref>{{cite web |title=All hail the Goblin King: David Bowie's 'Labyrinth' soundtrack being reissued |url=http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2017/4/27/all-hail-the-goblin-king-david-bowies-labyrinth-soundtrack-b.html |website=ABC Newsradio Online |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref> His final solo album of the decade was 1987's ''[[Never Let Me Down]]'', where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an [[Industrial music|industrial]]/[[techno]] dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits "[[Day-In Day-Out|Day-In, Day-Out]]" (his 60th single), "[[Time Will Crawl]]", and "[[Never Let Me Down (David Bowie song)|Never Let Me Down]]". Bowie later described it as his "nadir", calling it "an awful album".<ref>{{cite work|first=James|last=McNair|title=Tumble & Twirl|work=Mojo Classic|location=London, England|date=January 2007|issue=60 Years of Bowie|page=101}}</ref> Supporting ''Never Let Me Down'', and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert [[Glass Spider Tour]] commenced on 30 May.

===1989–1991: Tin Machine===
{{Main|Tin Machine}}
Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, [[Tin Machine]] came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist [[Reeves Gabrels]]. The line-up was completed by [[Tony Fox Sales|Tony]] and [[Hunt Sales]], whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album ''Lust for Life''.<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 387</ref>

[[File:David Bowie Chile.jpg|thumb|upright|Bowie in Chile during the [[Sound+Vision Tour]], 1990]]
Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making.<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 274</ref> The band's album debut, ''[[Tin Machine (album)|Tin Machine]]'' (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as "a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]]"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, "It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV&nbsp;... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book."<ref name="tinmachine1">Sandford (1997): p. 275</ref> EMI complained of "lyrics that preach" as well as "repetitive tunes" and "minimalist or no production".<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 273</ref> The album nevertheless reached No. 3 and went gold in the UK.<ref name="tinmachine1"/>

Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member.<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 394</ref> A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label.<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 278–79</ref> Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band.<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 278</ref> Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month [[Sound+Vision Tour]], he found commercial success and acclaim once again.<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 280–86</ref>

In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and [[Somalis|Somali]]-born supermodel [[Iman (model)|Iman]] were introduced by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, "I was naming the children the night we met&nbsp;... it was absolutely immediate." They married in 1992.<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 289</ref> Tin Machine resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second. ''[[Tin Machine II]]''{{'}}s arrival was marked by a widely publicised and ill-timed conflict over the cover art: after production had begun, the new record label, [[Victory Records|Victory]], deemed the depiction of four ancient nude [[Kouros|Kouroi]] statues, judged by Bowie to be "in exquisite taste", to be "a show of wrong, obscene images", requiring air-brushing and patching to render the figures sexless.<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 292</ref> Tin Machine toured again, but after the live album ''[[Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby]]'' failed commercially, the band drifted apart, and Bowie, though he continued to collaborate with Gabrels, resumed his solo career.<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 294–95</ref>

===1992–1998: Electronic period===
On 20 April 1992, Bowie appeared at [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]], following the Queen singer's death the previous year. As well as performing "Heroes" and "All the Young Dudes", he was joined on "Under Pressure" by [[Annie Lennox]], who took Mercury's vocal part; during his appearance, Bowie knelt and recited the [[Lord's Prayer]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 298–99</ref><ref name="LA Times Mercury">{{cite news|first=Jeff|last=Kaye|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-04-22-ca-497-story.html|title=(Safe) Sex, (No) Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll : A Star-Filled Send-Off to Freddie Mercury|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=22 April 1992|accessdate=11 January 2016}}</ref> Four days later, Bowie and Iman were married in Switzerland. Intending to move to Los Angeles, they flew in to search for a suitable property, but found themselves confined to their hotel, under curfew: the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] began the day they arrived. They settled in New York instead.<ref>Buckley (2005): pp. 413–14</ref>

[[File:David Bowie 1997.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bowie performing in [[Turku]], Finland, 1997]]
In 1993, Bowie released his first solo offering since his Tin Machine departure, the soul, jazz, and [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] influenced ''[[Black Tie White Noise]]''. Making prominent use of electronic instruments, the album, which reunited Bowie with ''Let's Dance'' producer [[Nile Rodgers]], confirmed Bowie's return to popularity, hitting the number-one spot on the UK charts and spawning three Top 40 hits, including the Top 10 single "[[Jump They Say]]".<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 301–08</ref> Bowie explored new directions on ''[[The Buddha of Suburbia (soundtrack)|The Buddha of Suburbia]]'' (1993), ostensibly a soundtrack album of his music composed for the BBC television adaptation of [[The Buddha of Suburbia (novel)|Hanif Kureishi's novel]]. Only the title track had been used in the television adaptation, although some of his [[Subject (music)|themes]] for it were also present on the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/david-bowie-the-buddha-of-suburbia-2496207891.html |last=Keefe |first=Michael |title=David Bowie The Buddha of Suburbia |work=PopMatters |date=16 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327123037/https://www.popmatters.com/david-bowie-the-buddha-of-suburbia-2496207891.html |archivedate=27 March 2019 |url-status=live |accessdate=6 January 2017 }}</ref> It contained some of the new elements introduced in ''Black Tie White Noise'', and also signalled a move towards [[alternative rock]]. The album was a critical success but received a low-key release and only made No. 87 in the UK charts.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 494–95, 623</ref>

Reuniting Bowie with Eno, the quasi-[[industrial music|industrial]] ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]]'' (1995) was originally conceived as the first volume in a non-linear narrative of art and murder. Featuring characters from a short story written by Bowie, the album achieved UK and US chart success, and yielded three Top 40 UK singles.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 623–24</ref> In a move that provoked mixed reaction from both fans and critics, Bowie chose [[Nine Inch Nails]] as his tour partner for the [[Outside Tour]]. Visiting cities in Europe and North America between September 1995 and February 1996, the tour saw the return of Gabrels as Bowie's guitarist.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 512–13</ref> On 7 January 1997, Bowie celebrated his half century with a [[Earthling (album)#Live performances|50th birthday concert]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], New York, at which he was joined in playing his songs and those of his guests, Lou Reed, [[Dave Grohl]] and the [[Foo Fighters]], [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[the Cure]], [[Billy Corgan]] of [[the Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Black Francis]] of the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], and [[Sonic Youth]].<ref>{{cite news|title=David Bowie Birthday Celebration Live Album an Unauthorized Bootleg|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/03/david-bowie-to-release-live-album-featuring-foo-fi.html|work=Paste Magazine|date=21 March 2011|first=Nathan|last=Spicer}}</ref>

Bowie was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on 17 January 1996.<ref name="rockhall">{{cite web|title=David Bowie: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction|website=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/david-bowie|accessdate=16 September 2010}}</ref> Incorporating experiments in British jungle and [[drum and bass|drum 'n' bass]], ''[[Earthling (album)|Earthling]]'' (1997) was a critical and commercial success in the UK and the US, and two singles from the album – "[[Little Wonder (song)|Little Wonder]]" and "[[Dead Man Walking (song)|Dead Man Walking]]" – became UK Top 40 hits. Bowie's song "[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]" from the [[Paul Verhoeven]] film ''[[Showgirls]]'' was re-recorded for the album, and remixed by [[Trent Reznor]] for a single release. The heavy rotation of the accompanying video, also featuring [[Trent Reznor]], contributed to the song's 16-week stay in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Reznor also executive produced the ''[[Lost Highway (soundtrack)|Lost Highway]]'' soundtrack (1997) which begins and ends with different mixes of Bowie's ''Outside'' song "[[I'm Deranged]]".<ref>{{cite web |title=Lost Highway [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack] |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/lost-highway-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000082314 |website=Allmusic}}</ref> Bowie received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on 12 February 1997.<ref name=DB97x>{{citation | url=https://www.davidbowie.com/1997/1997/01/30/david-bowie-launches-new-album-earthling-with-network-television-appearances-a-pay-per-view-concert-a-national-radio-broadcast-and-star-on-hollywood-blvds-walk-of-fame | title=David Bowie Launches New Album 'earthling' With Network Television Appearances, A Pay-per-view Concert, A National Radio Broadcast, And Star On Hollywood Blvd's Walk Of Fame | date=30 January 1997 | accessdate=5 July 2013 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113001444/https://www.davidbowie.com/1997/1997/01/30/david-bowie-launches-new-album-earthling-with-network-television-appearances-a-pay-per-view-concert-a-national-radio-broadcast-and-star-on-hollywood-blvds-walk-of-fame | archivedate=13 January 2020 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Earthling Tour]] took in Europe and North America between June and November 1997.<ref name="Buckley pp. 533–34">Buckley (2000): pp. 533–34</ref> In November 1997, Bowie performed on the BBC's [[Children in Need]] charity single "[[Perfect Day 97|Perfect Day]]", which reached number one in the UK.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/oh-its-such-a-perfect-song-1293130.html|title=Oh, it's such a perfect song|newspaper=The Independent|date=9 November 1997|accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref> Bowie reunited with Visconti in 1998 to record "(Safe in This) Sky Life" for ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]''.

Bowie, with Reeves Gabrels, created the soundtrack for ''[[Omikron: The Nomad Soul]]'', a 1999 computer game in which he and Iman also voiced characters based on their likenesses. Released the same year and containing re-recorded tracks from ''Omikron'', his album ''[[Hours (David Bowie album)|Hours]]'' featured a song with lyrics by the winner of his "Cyber Song Contest" Internet competition, Alex Grant.<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 466</ref> Making extensive use of live instruments, the album was Bowie's exit from heavy electronica.<ref>Perone (2007): p. 125</ref> Sessions for the planned album ''[[Toy (David Bowie album)|Toy]]'', intended to feature new versions of some of Bowie's earliest pieces as well as three new songs, commenced in 2000, but the album was never released.

[[File:David Bowie (135687113).jpeg|thumb|left|Bowie performing in Dublin, Ireland in November 2003 during the [[A Reality Tour]]—his last tour following his 2006 retirement from touring.]]
In October 2001, Bowie opened [[the Concert for New York City]], a charity event to benefit the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]], with a minimalist performance of [[Simon & Garfunkel]]'s "[[America (Simon & Garfunkel song)|America]]", followed by a full band performance of "Heroes".<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 491</ref> 2002 saw the release of ''Heathen'', and, during the second half of the year, the [[Heathen Tour]]. Taking place in Europe and North America, the tour opened at London's annual ''[[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown]]'' festival, for which Bowie was that year appointed artistic director. Among the acts he selected for the festival were [[Philip Glass]], [[Television (band)|Television]], and [[the Dandy Warhols]]. As well as songs from the new album, the tour featured material from Bowie's ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' era.<ref>Buckley (2005): pp. 493–95</ref> ''[[Reality (David Bowie album)|Reality]]'' (2003) followed, and its accompanying world tour, the [[A Reality Tour]], with an estimated attendance of 722,000, grossed more than any other in 2004. On 13 June, Bowie headlined the last night of the [[Isle of Wight Festival 2004]] in what would prove to be his last live show in the UK.<ref>{{cite news |title=David Bowie's agent says the musician has 'performed his last live show' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11928406/david-bowie-retried-last-show.html |accessdate=27 June 2020 |newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref> On 25 June he suffered chest pain while performing at the [[Hurricane Festival]] in [[Scheeßel]], Germany.

The remaining 14 dates of the tour were cancelled.<ref>Buckley (2005): pp. 504–05</ref>

In the years following his recuperation from the heart attack, Bowie reduced his musical output, making only one-off appearances on stage and in the studio.

In a 2017 interview with ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'', director [[Denis Villeneuve]] revealed his intention to cast Bowie in ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'' as the lead villain, Niander Wallace, but when news broke of Bowie's death in January of the same year, Villeneuve was forced to look for talent with similar "rock star" qualities. He eventually cast actor and lead singer of [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]], [[Jared Leto]]. Talking about the casting process, Villeneuve said: "Our first thought [for the character] had been David Bowie, who had influenced ''[[Blade Runner]]'' in many ways. When we learned the sad news, we looked around for someone like that. He [Bowie] embodied the Blade Runner spirit.".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/11/denis-villeneuve-on-wanting-to-cast-david-bowie-he-embodied-the-blade-runner-spirit/|title=Denis Villeneuve on wanting to cast David Bowie: "He embodied the Blade Runner spirit"|date=16 November 2017|magazine=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref> David Lynch also hoped to have Bowie reprise his ''Fire Walk With Me'' character for ''[[Twin Peaks (season 3)|Twin Peaks: The Return]]'' but Bowie's illness prevented this. His character was portrayed via archival footage. At Bowie's request, Lynch overdubbed Bowie's original dialogue with a different actor's voice, as Bowie was unhappy with his [[Cajun]] accent in the original movie.<ref>{{cite web |title=How David Lynch and Twin Peaks Honored One Final David Bowie Request |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/twin-peaks-david-bowie-david-lynch-voice-over-request |website=Vanity Fair |accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref>

Bowie was also a painter and artist. He moved to Switzerland in 1976, purchasing a chalet in the hills to the north of [[Lake Geneva]]. In the new environment, his cocaine use decreased and he found time for other pursuits outside his musical career.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Malcolm|last=Curtis|url=https://www.thelocal.ch/20160111/bowies-discreet-time-in-switzerland-remembered|title=Bowie's discreet time in Switzerland recalled|work=[[The Local]]|location=Stockholm, Sweden|date=11 January 2016|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref> He devoted more time to his painting, and produced a number of [[post-modernist]] pieces. When on tour, he took to sketching in a notebook, and photographing scenes for later reference.

Bowie's songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development. Bowie was a pioneer of glam rock, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, who credited [[Marc Bolan]] and Bowie with creating the genre.<ref name="Schinder & Schwartz 2007: p. 482">Schinder & Schwartz (2007): p. 482</ref> At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the [[punk rock]] music movement.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Popular Music in America:The Beat Goes On|last = Campbell|first = Michael|publisher = Schirmer|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0840029768|location = United States|page = 345}}</ref> When punk musicians were "noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance", biographer David Buckley wrote that "Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation."<ref>Campbell (2008) p. 304</ref><ref>Buckley (2004): p. 45</ref> Bowie's record company promoted his unique status in popular music with the slogan, "There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie".<ref>Thomson (1993): p. 217</ref>

Broadcaster [[John Peel]] contrasted Bowie with his [[progressive rock]] contemporaries, arguing that Bowie was "an interesting kind of fringe figure... on the outskirts of things". Peel said he "liked the idea of him reinventing himself... the one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didn't progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change". Buckley called the era "bloated, self-important, leather-clad, self-satisfied"; then Bowie "subverted the whole notion of what it was to be a rock star".<!-- See ref "buckley_legacy" to follow. -->

{{quote|After Bowie there has been no other pop icon of his stature, because the pop world that produces these rock gods doesn't exist any more.&nbsp;...

==Musicianship==

From the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and rollers like [[Little Richard]] and [[Elvis Presley]], and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor [[Anthony Newley]], whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, ''[[David Bowie (1967 album)|David Bowie]]'' (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher).<ref name="albumdebut">Sandford (1997): pp. 41–42</ref><ref>Perone (2007): p. 4</ref> Bowie's [[music hall]] fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk, and pop.<ref>Perone (2007): pp. 22, 36–37</ref>

Musicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, "[[Space Oddity]]", and later in the song "[["Heroes" (song)|Heroes]]", to dramatic effect; Perone notes that "in the lowest part of his vocal register&nbsp;... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness."<ref>Perone (2007) p. 12</ref>

===Family===

Bowie married his first wife, [[Angela Bowie|Mary Angela Barnett]] on 19 March 1970 at [[Bromley Town Hall|Bromley Register Office]] in [[Bromley]], London. They had an [[open marriage]]. Angela described their union as a marriage of convenience. "We got married so that I could [get a permit to] work. I didn't think it would last and David said, before we got married, 'I'm not really in love with you' and I thought that's probably a good thing," she said. Bowie said about Angela that "living with her is like living with a blow torch."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/why-i-gave-up-my-son-zowie-7279091.html|title=Angie Bowie: 'Why I gave up my son Zowie'|last=Saner|first=Emine|date=17 March 2006|website=Evening Standard|access-date=}}</ref> Their son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], born on 30 May 1971, was at first known as Zowie.<ref>Doggett (2011): p. 114</ref> Bowie and Angela divorced on 8 February 1980 in Switzerland.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sandford|first1=Christopher|title=Bowie: Loving The Alien|date=5 August 2009|publisher=Da Capo Press|page=197}}</ref> Bowie received custody of their son.

In a 1983 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was "the biggest mistake I ever made" and "I was always a closet heterosexual."<ref>{{cite news|title=David Bowie Calls Himself 'A Closet Heterosexual'|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=30 May 1993|accessdate=13 May 2012|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-05-30/news/9305300344_1_david-bowie-mick-jagger-ziggy}}</ref> On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings.<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 106</ref>{{efn|In 1993, Bowie recalled having read ''[[City of Night]]'' in the 1960s, and it connected with his loneliness.

''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' asked Bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, "I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people." Bowie said he wanted to be a songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in "[[Puritans|puritanical]]" America, "I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do."<ref>{{cite news|last=Collis |first=Clark |title=Dear Superstar: David Bowie |work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |date=August 2002 |accessdate=16 September 2010 |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=366 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510103103/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=366 |archivedate=10 May 2008 }}</ref>

Buckley wrote that Bowie "mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock",<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 141</ref> and was probably "never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual", instead experimenting "out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional'."<ref>Buckley (2005): p. 147</ref> Biographer Christopher Sandford said, according to Mary Finnigan—with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969—the singer and his first wife Angie "created their bisexual fantasy".<ref name=sandford48>Sandford (1997): p. 48</ref> Sandford wrote that Bowie "made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while 'fucking the same bloke'&nbsp;...

===Spirituality and religion===
Over the years, Bowie made numerous references to religions and to his evolving spirituality.

===Politics===
In 1976, speaking as [[The Thin White Duke]], Bowie's persona at the time, and "at least partially tongue-in-cheek", he made statements that expressed support for fascism and perceived admiration for [[Adolf Hitler]] in interviews with ''[[Playboy]]'', ''NME'', and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: "Britain is ready for a fascist leader... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership." He was also quoted as saying: "Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars" and "You've got to have an [[Far-right politics|extreme right]] front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-the-clash-rock-against-racism-in-1978-20140513|title=Flashback: The Clash Rock Against Racism in 1978|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=15 January 2015|date=13 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.race|title=1978, the year rock found the power to unite|last=Manzoor|first=Sarfraz|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=15 January 2015|date=20 April 2008}}</ref> Bowie later retracted these comments in an interview with ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in October 1977, blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems at the time, saying: "I was out of my mind, totally, completely crazed."<ref>{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Mikal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/cover-story-excerpt-david-bowie-20120118|title=Cover Story Excerpt: David Bowie|work=Rolling Stone|date=18 January 2012|accessdate=11 January 2016}}</ref>

In the 1980s and 1990s, Bowie's public statements shifted sharply towards [[anti-racism]] and [[anti-fascism]]. In an interview with [[MTV]] anchor [[Mark Goodman]] in 1983, Bowie criticised the channel for not providing enough coverage of black musicians, becoming visibly uncomfortable when the host suggested concerns among midwestern viewers was a reason.<ref name="MTV video">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZGiVzIr8Qg|title=David Bowie Criticizes MTV for Not Playing Videos by Black Artists|via=YouTube|year=1983|publisher=MTV News|access-date=13 January 2016}}</ref><ref name="Jet Black artists">{{cite magazine|title=Why It Took So Long For MTV To Play Black Videos|first=Margena A|last=Christian|magazine=Jet|date=9 October 2006|page=17}}</ref> The music videos for "China Girl" and "Let's Dance" were described by Bowie as a "very simple, very direct" statement against racism.<ref name=RS83>{{cite magazine | last=Loder | first=Kurt | author-link=Kurt Loder | title=Straight Time | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | issue=395 | date=12 May 1983 | pages=22–28, 81}}</ref> The album ''Tin Machine'' took a more direct stance against fascism and Neo-Nazism, and was criticised for being too preachy.<ref name="tinmachine1"/>

Bowie's producer Tony Visconti wrote:

{{quote|He always did what he wanted to do. And he wanted to do it his way and he wanted to do it the best way. His death was no different from his life – a work of art. He made ''Blackstar'' for us, his parting gift. I knew for a year this was the way it would be. I wasn't, however, prepared for it. He was an extraordinary man, full of love and life.
