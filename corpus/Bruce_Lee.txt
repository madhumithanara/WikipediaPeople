'''Lee Jun-fan''' ({{zh|t=李振藩}}; November 27, 1940&nbsp;– July 20, 1973), commonly known as '''Bruce Lee''' ({{zh|李小龍}}), was a [[Hong Kong American]] actor, director,  martial artist, martial arts instructor and philosopher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bruceleefoundation.com/index.cfm?pid=10606 |title=Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do |publisher=Bruce Lee Foundation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723235948/http://www.bruceleefoundation.com/index.cfm?pid=10606 |archivedate=July 23, 2010 }}</ref> He was the founder of [[Jeet Kune Do]], a [[hybrid martial arts]] philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is often credited with paving the way for modern [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA). Lee is considered by commentators, critics, media, and other martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]]. He is credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films.<ref name="Time 100">{{cite web |url=http://205.188.238.181/time/time100/heroes/profile/lee01.html |title=Bruce Lee: With nothing but his hands, feet and a lot of attitude, he turned the little guy into a tough guy |last=Stein |first=Joel |date=June 14, 1999 |work=The Time 100 |accessdate=June 7, 2010 |location=New York |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605174143/http://205.188.238.181/time/time100/heroes/profile/lee01.html |archivedate=June 5, 2010}}</ref>

The son of [[Cantonese opera]] star [[Lee Hoi-chuen]], Lee was born in the [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] area of [[San Francisco, California]], on November 27, 1940, to parents from [[Hong Kong]], and was raised with his family in [[Kowloon]], Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brucelee.com/bruce-lee |title=Bruce Lee |website=Bruce Lee}}</ref> He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor. Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]],<ref name="TheBruceLeeStory41">{{harvnb|Lee|1989|p=41}}</ref> and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and [[Hollywood]]-produced films elevated the traditional [[martial arts film]] to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in the [[Chinese nation]] and [[Chinese martial arts]] in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films dramatically changed and influenced martial arts and [[martial arts film]]s in the world.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-01/news-interviews/28300963_1_martial-arts-dev-patel-bruce-lee |title=Bruce Lee inspired Dev for martial arts |work=The Times of India |date=July 1, 2010 |accessdate=June 3, 2011}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

He is noted for his roles in five feature-length martial arts films in the early 1970s: [[Lo Wei]]'s ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971) and ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (1972); [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]]'s ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' (1972), directed and written by Lee; Golden Harvest and [[Warner Brothers]]' ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Game of Death|The Game of Death]]'' (1978), both directed by [[Robert Clouse]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/article2058091.ece |title=How Bruce Lee changed the world-Series |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=May 29, 2011 |accessdate=June 3, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025084120/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/article2058091.ece |archivedate=October 25, 2012}}</ref> Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], based upon his portrayal of [[Chinese nationalism]] in his films<ref>{{harvnb|Dennis|1974|p=}}</ref> and among [[Asian Americans]] for defying stereotypes associated with the [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States#Emasculation and asexuality|emasculated Asian male]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=McDermon |first1=Daniel |title=How Bruce Lee Exploded a Stereotype With a One-Inch Punch |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/movies/bruce-lee-movies.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=October 15, 2018}}</ref> He trained in the art of [[Wing Chun]] and later combined his other influences from various sources into the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist).

Lee died on July 20, 1973 at the age of 32. There was no visible external injury; however, according to autopsy reports, Lee's brain had swollen considerably. The autopsy found [[Equagesic]] in his system. When the doctors announced Lee's death, it was officially ruled a "[[death by misadventure]]". Since his death, Lee has continued to be a prominent influence on modern [[combat sport]], including [[judo]], [[karate]], mixed martial arts, and [[boxing]]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named Lee one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most important people of the 20th century]].

Lee's father [[Lee Hoi-chuen]] was a famous [[Cantonese opera]] star. Because of this, Lee was introduced into films at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child. Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film ''[[Golden Gate Girl]]''.<ref name="CampbellLee2003">{{cite book|author1=Sid Campbell|author2=Greglon Lee|title=Dragon and the Tiger: The Birth of Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do - The Oakland Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0-SOx2NT6AC&pg=PA1|year=2003|publisher=Frog Books|isbn=978-1-58394-089-1|pages=1–}}</ref> As a nine-year-old, he would co-star with his father in ''[[The Kid (1950 film)|The Kid]]'' in 1950, which was based on a comic book character and was his first leading role.<ref name="BerryFarquhar2006">{{cite book|author1=Christopher J.

After Lee was involved in several [[street fights]], his parents decided that he needed to be trained in the martial arts. Lee's first introduction to martial arts was through his father, from whom he learned the fundamentals of [[Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=14}}</ref>[[File:The age of 18 Bruce Lee and Ye Wen.jpg|thumb|Lee and Yip Man]]
The largest influence on Lee's martial arts development was his study of [[Wing Chun]].<ref name="Haines2011">{{cite book|author=Bruce Haines|title=Karate's History & Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4zTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT131|date=22 November 2011|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-1-4629-0139-5|pages=131–}}</ref> Lee began training in Wing Chun when he was 16 years old under the Wing Chun teacher [[Yip Man]] in between late 1956 and 1957, after losing to rival gang members. Yip's regular classes generally consisted of the forms practice, ''chi sao'' (sticking hands) drills, wooden dummy techniques, and free-sparring.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition'' Summer 1993</ref> There was no set pattern to the classes.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Yip tried to keep his students from fighting in the street gangs of Hong Kong by encouraging them to fight in organized competitions.<ref>''Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition'' Summer 1993, p. 18.</ref>

After a year into his Wing Chun training, most of Yip Man's other students refused to train with Lee when they had learned of his mixed ancestry, as the Chinese were generally against teaching their martial arts techniques to non-Asians.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=26}}{{sfn|Sharif|2009|p=56}} Lee's sparring partner, Hawkins Cheung, states, "Probably fewer than six people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught, or even partly taught, by Yip Man".<ref>Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition Summer 1993 p. 19.</ref> However, Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun and continued to train privately with Yip Man and [[Wong Shun Leung]].{{sfn|Campbell|2006|p=172}} [[Wan Kam Leung]], a student of Wong's, witnessed a sparring bout between Wong and Lee and noted the speed and precision with which Lee was able to deliver his kicks.<ref>{{YouTube|LjuYLc4kt7w|Wan Kam Leung recalls Bruce lee fighting with Wong Shun Leung}} (July 25, 2009).

After attending Tak Sun School ({{lang|zh|德信學校}}; several blocks from his home at 218 [[Nathan Road]], [[Kowloon]]), Lee entered the primary school division of the [[Catholic school|Catholic]] [[La Salle College]] at the age of 12.<ref name="Thomas1994">{{cite book|author=Bruce Thomas|title=Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit : a Biography|url=https://archive.org/details/bruceleefighting0000thom_d0z5|url-access=registration|year=1994|publisher=Frog Books|isbn=978-1-883319-25-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bruceleefighting0000thom_d0z5/page/11 11]–}}</ref> In 1956, due to poor academic performance and possibly poor conduct, he was transferred to [[St. Francis Xavier's College]], where he would be mentored by Brother Edward, a teacher and coach of the school [[boxing]] team.

=== 1959 to 1964: Continuous studies and martial arts breakthrough ===
In the spring of 1959, Lee got into another street fight, and the police were called.<ref>{{cite web |last=Burrows |first=Alyssa |title=Bruce Lee |publisher=HistoryLink |year=2002 |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3999 |accessdate=May 30, 2008}}</ref>
Until his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared [[Triad (organized crime)|triad]] family.<ref name="LeeLee1989">{{cite book|author1=Linda Lee|author2=Mike Lee|title=The Bruce Lee Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2NAuMRjSUSIC&pg=PA26|year=1989|publisher=Black Belt Communications|isbn=978-0-89750-121-7|pages=26–}}</ref> Eventually, Lee's father decided his son should leave Hong Kong to pursue a safer and healthier life in the United States. His parents confirmed the police's fear that this time Lee's opponent had an organized crime background and that there was the possibility that a contract was out for his life.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In April 1959, Lee's parents decided to send him to the United States to stay with his older sister, Agnes Lee ({{lang|zh|李秋鳳}}), who was already living with family friends in San Francisco. After several months, he moved to [[Seattle]] in 1959 to continue his high school education, where he also worked for [[Ruby Chow]] as a live-in waiter at her restaurant. Chow's husband was a co-worker and friend of Lee's father. Lee's elder brother Peter Lee ({{lang|zh|李忠琛}}) would also join him in Seattle for a short stay before moving on to [[Minnesota]] to attend college. That year Lee also started to teach martial arts. He called what he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu (literally Bruce Lee's Kung Fu). It was basically his approach to [[Wing Chun]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hardcorejkd.com/wing_chun.php|title=Wing Chung Gung Fu|publisher=Hardcore JKD|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514160028/http://www.hardcorejkd.com/wing_chun.php|archivedate=May 14, 2008|accessdate=May 30, 2008}}</ref> Lee taught friends he met in Seattle, starting with [[Judo]] practitioner [[Jesse Glover]], who continued to teach some of Lee's early techniques.

In December 1960, Lee completed his high school education and received his diploma from [[Seattle Central Community College|Edison Technical School]] on [[Capitol Hill (Seattle)|Capitol Hill]] in Seattle.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In March 1961, Lee enrolled at the [[University of Washington]] and studied dramatic arts, philosophy, psychology, and various other subjects.<ref>{{harvnb|Little|2001|p=32}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=42}}</ref> Despite what Lee himself and many others have stated, Lee's official major was drama rather than philosophy according to a 1999 article in the university's alumni publication.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/dec99/j_o.html |title=U. of Washington alumni records |publisher=Washington.edu |accessdate=January 22, 2010}}</ref>

Lee dropped out of college in early 1964 and moved to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] to live with [[James Yimm Lee]]. James Lee was twenty years senior to Bruce Lee and a well-known Chinese martial artist in the area. Together, they founded the second Jun Fan martial arts studio in Oakland. James Lee was also responsible for introducing Bruce Lee to [[Ed Parker]], an American martial artist. At the invitation of Parker, Lee appeared in the 1964 [[Long Beach International Karate Championships]] and performed repetitions of two-finger push-ups (using the thumb and the index finger of one hand) with feet at approximately shoulder-width apart. In the same Long Beach event he also performed the "[[one inch punch]]."<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=May 30, 2008 |url=http://www.maniacworld.com/bruce_lee_3.htm |title=Two Finger Pushup |publisher=Maniac World|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521195049/http://www.maniacworld.com/bruce_lee_3.htm |archivedate=May 21, 2008}}</ref> Lee stood upright, his right foot forward with knees bent slightly, in front of a standing, stationary partner. Lee's right arm was partly extended and his right fist approximately {{convert|1|in|cm|spell=in}} away from the partner's chest. Without retracting his right arm, Lee then forcibly delivered the punch to volunteer Bob Baker while largely maintaining his posture, sending Baker backwards and falling into a chair said to be placed behind Baker to prevent injury, though Baker's momentum soon caused him to fall to the floor. Baker recalled, "I told Bruce not to do this type of demonstration again. When he punched me that last time, I had to stay home from work because the pain in my chest was unbearable".<ref>{{harvnb|Vaughn|1986|p=21}}</ref> It was at the 1964 championships that Lee first met [[Taekwondo]] master [[Jhoon Goo Rhee]].

In [[Oakland, California|Oakland's]] [[Chinatown, Oakland|Chinatown]] in 1964, Lee had a controversial private match with [[Wong Jack Man]], a direct student of Ma Kin Fung, known for his mastery of [[Xingyiquan]], [[Northern Shaolin (martial art)|Northern Shaolin]], and [[T'ai chi ch'uan]]. According to Lee, the Chinese community issued an ultimatum to him to stop teaching non-Chinese people. When he refused to comply, he was challenged to a combat match with Wong. The arrangement was that if Lee lost, he would have to shut down his school, while if he won, he would be free to teach white people, or anyone else.<ref name="ReferenceB">''Bruce Lee: The Immortal Dragon'', January 29, 2002, A&E Television Networks</ref> Wong denied this, stating that he requested to fight Lee after Lee boasted during one of his demonstrations at a Chinatown theatre that he could beat anyone in San Francisco, and that Wong himself did not discriminate against Whites or other non-Chinese people.<ref name="Dorgan">{{harvnb|Dorgan|1980|p=}}</ref> Lee commented, "That paper had all the names of the [[sifu]] from Chinatown, but they don't scare me".<ref>''Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition'', Summer 1993 Rainbow Publications Inc, p. 117</ref> Individuals known to have witnessed the match include Cadwell, James Lee (Bruce Lee's associate, no relation), and William Chen, a teacher of T'ai chi ch'uan.

When Wong presented the traditional handshake, Lee appeared to accept the greeting, but instead, Lee allegedly thrust his hand as a spear aimed at Wong's eyes. Forced to defend his life, Wong nonetheless asserted that he refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could have earned him a prison sentence, but used illegal cufflings under his sleeves. The fight ended due to Lee's "unusually winded" condition, as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter.<ref name="Dorgan" /> By contrast, according to Bruce Lee, [[Linda Lee Cadwell]], and [[James Yimm Lee]], the fight lasted a mere 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Lee. In Cadwell's account, "The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said 'Do you give up?' and the man said he gave up".<ref name="ReferenceB" /> A couple of weeks after the bout, Lee gave an interview claiming that he had defeated an unnamed challenger, which Wong says was an obvious reference to him.<ref name="Dorgan" /><ref name="Mental Floss" /> In response, Wong published his own account of the fight in the Chinese ''Pacific Weekly'', a [[Chinese-language]] newspaper in San Francisco, with an invitation to a public rematch if Lee was not satisfied with the account. Lee did not respond to the invitation despite his reputation for violently responding to every provocation,<ref name="Dorgan" /> and there were no further public announcements by either, though Lee continued to teach white people. Lee had abandoned thoughts of a film career in favour of pursuing martial arts. However, a martial arts exhibition on Long Beach in 1964 eventually led to the invitation by [[television producer]] [[William Dozier]] for an audition for a role in the pilot for "Number One Son" about Lee Chan, the son of [[Charlie Chan]]. The show never materialized, but Dozier saw potential in Lee.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Aarons|first=Leroy F.|date=October 2, 1966|title=Color Him Green|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/38977251/color_him_green/|journal=Tampa Bay Times|volume=83|pages=148|via=Newspapers}}</ref>

[[The Green Hornet]] introduced the adult Bruce Lee to an American audience, and became the first popular American show presenting Asian-style [[Modern history of East Asian martial arts|martial arts]]. The show's director wanted Lee to fight in the typical American style using fists and punches. As a professional martial artist, Lee refused, insisting that he should fight in the style of his expertise. At first, Lee moved so fast that his movements could not be caught on film, so he had to slow them down.<ref name="American Heritage Center">{{cite web | title=American Heritage Center Blog: Bruce Lee Steals the Show in ""The Green Hornet"" | work=American Heritage Center | date=March 16, 2020 |  url=https://ahcwyo.org/2020/03/16/bruce-lee-steals-the-show-in-the-green-hornet/}}</ref> After the show was cancelled in 1967, Lee wrote to Dozier thanking him for starting "my career in show business."<ref name="American Heritage Center"/>

In 1967, Lee played a role in one episode of ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]].''[[File:JeetKuneDo.svg|thumb|The [[Jeet Kune Do]] emblem is a registered trademark held by the Bruce Lee Estate. The [[Chinese character]]s around the [[Taijitu]] symbol read: "Using no way as way" and "Having no limitation as limitation" The arrows represent the endless interaction between yang and yin.<ref>{{harvnb|Bishop|2004|p=23}}</ref>|alt=|left]]
Jeet Kune Do originated in 1967. After filming one season of ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'', Lee found himself out of work and opened The Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute. The controversial match with Wong Jack Man influenced Lee's philosophy about martial arts. Lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential using his [[Wing Chun]] techniques. He took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalized to be practical in scenarios of chaotic [[street fighting]]. Lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on "practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency". He started to use different methods of training such as [[weight training]] for strength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility, and many others which he constantly adapted, including [[fencing]] and basic [[boxing]] techniques.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Lee was influenced by [[heavyweight boxing]] champion [[Muhammad Ali]], whose [[Footwork (martial arts)|footwork]] he studied and incorporated into his own style.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Vaughn |editor-first1=Jack |editor-last2=Lee |editor-first2=Mike |title=The Legendary Bruce Lee |date=1986 |publisher=[[Black Belt Communications]] |isbn=978-0-89750-106-4 |page=127 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D8d_YjWV9k4C&pg=PA127}}</ref>

Lee emphasized what he called "the style of no style". This consisted of getting rid of the formalized approach which Lee claimed was indicative of traditional styles. Lee felt that even the system he now called Jun Fan Gung Fu was too restrictive, and it eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call ''Jeet Kune Do'' or the ''Way of the Intercepting Fist.'' It is a term he would later regret, because Jeet Kune Do implied specific parameters that styles connote, whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=81}}</ref>

At the time, two of Lee's martial arts students were Hollywood script writer [[Stirling Silliphant]] and actor [[James Coburn]]. In 1969 the three worked on a script for a film called ''The Silent Flute'', and went together on a location hunt to [[India]]. The project was not realised at the time, but the 1978 film ''[[Circle of Iron]]'', starring [[David Carradine]], was based on the same plot. In 2010, producer Paul Maslansky was reported to have planned and received funding for a film based on the original script for ''The Silent Flute''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=McNary|first=Dave|date=April 15, 2010|title=Bruce Lee's 'Flute' heads to bigscreen&nbsp;– Entertainment News, Film News, Media|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118017805.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|magazine=Variety|accessdate=February 22, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027034712/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118017805.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|archive-date=October 27, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1969, Lee made a brief appearance in the Silliphant-penned film ''[[Marlowe (film)|Marlowe]]'', where he played a hoodlum hired to intimidate private detective [[Philip Marlowe]], (played by [[James Garner]]), who uses his martial arts abilities to commit acts of vandalization to intimidate Marlowe.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Muss|first=H.P.|date=October 31, 1969|title=Meet Master Of Jeet Kune Do|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/38637271/meet_master_of_jeet_kune_do/|journal=The Cincinnati Enquirer|pages=10|via=Newspapers}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/22951-MARLOWE?cxt=filmography|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref> The same year he was credited as the karate advisor in ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1969 film)|The Wrecking Crew]], the''  fourth instalment of the [[Matt Helm]] comedy [[Spy-fi (neologism)|spy-fi]] film starring [[Dean Martin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/23670-THE-WRECKING-CREW?cxt=filmography|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref> Also that year, Lee acted in one episode of ''[[Here Come the Brides]]'' and ''[[Blondie (1968 TV series)|Blondie]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=July 27, 1969|title=Prospective Bridal Pair|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39148181/prospective_bridal_pair/|journal=The Journal Times|volume=113|pages=34|via=Newspapers}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=January 4, 1969|title=Wednesday|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39148199/wednesday_part_2/|journal=Chicago Tribune|pages=60|via=Newspapers}}</ref>

Lee played his first leading role in ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971), which proved to be an enormous box office success across Asia and catapulted him to stardom. He soon followed up with ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (1972), which broke the box office records set previously by ''The Big Boss''. Having finished his initial two-year contract, Lee negotiated a new deal with Golden Harvest. Lee later formed his own company, [[Concord Production Inc.]], with Chow.

==Artistry==
===Philosophy===
While best known as a martial artist, Lee also studied drama and Asian and Western philosophy starting while a student at the University of Washington. He was well-read and had an extensive library dominated by martial arts subjects and philosophical texts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://houseofbrucelee.blogspot.tw/2012/08/books.html |title=Inside Bruce Lee's Personal Library|website=houseofbrucelee.blogspot.tw}}</ref> His own books on martial arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions, both inside and outside of martial arts circles. His [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to claim that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings. He believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self-knowledge, and said that his chosen method of self-expression was martial arts.<ref name="warriorwithin122" /> His influences include [[Taoism]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], and [[Buddhism]].<ref>[[Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey]] at 31m45s</ref> Lee's philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservative worldview advocated by [[Confucianism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bolelli|2008|p=161}}</ref> John Little states that Lee was an [[Atheism|atheist]]. When asked in 1972 about his religious affiliation, he replied, "none whatsoever",<ref name="warriorwithin128">{{harvnb|Little|1996|p=128}}</ref> and when asked if he believed in God, he said, "To be perfectly frank, I really do not."<ref name="warriorwithin122">{{harvnb|Little|1996|p=122}}</ref>

===Poetry===
Aside from [[martial arts]] and philosophy, which focus on the physical aspect and self-consciousness for truths and principles,<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Bruce |title=The Warrior Within |year=1996 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Martial arts-Philosophy |isbn=0-8092-3194-8 |editor=John Little |url=https://archive.org/details/warriorwithinphi00litt}}</ref> Lee also wrote poetry that reflected his emotion and a stage in his life collectively.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Bruce |title=Bruce Lee Artist of Life |year=1999 |publisher=Tuttle |isbn=978-0-8048-3263-2 |pages=93–116 |author2=Linda Lee Cadwell |editor=John Little |type=Book}}</ref> Many forms of art remain concordant with the artist creating them. Lee's principle of self-expression was applied to his poetry as well. His daughter Shannon Lee said, "He did write poetry; he was really the consummate artist."<ref>{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Shannon |title=Bruce Lee's Poetry: Shannon Lee reads one of her father's handwritten poems |url=http://www.brucelee.com/index.cfm/page/Bruce-Lee-s-Poetry---Shannon-Lee-reads-one-of-her-father-s-handwritten-poems/pid/10277/cdid/10363 |work=Poetry |accessdate=April 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106192413/https://www.brucelee.com/index.cfm/page/Bruce-Lee-s-Poetry---Shannon-Lee-reads-one-of-her-father-s-handwritten-poems/pid/10277/cdid/10363 |archivedate=November 6, 2012}}</ref> His poetic works were originally handwritten on paper, then later on edited and published, with John Little being the major author (editor), for Bruce Lee's works. Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce Lee's wife) shared her husband's notes, poems, and experiences with followers. She mentioned "Lee's poems are, by American standards, rather dark—reflecting the deeper, less exposed recesses of the human psyche".<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Bruce |title=Bruce Lee Artist of Life |year=1999 |publisher=Tuttle |location=Martial Arts |isbn=978-0-8048-3263-2 |page=92 |author2=Linda Lee Cadwell |editor=John Little |type=Book |chapter=Part 4 Poetry}}</ref> Most of Bruce Lee's poems are categorized as [[anti-poetry]] or fall into a [[paradox]]. The mood in his poems shows the side of the man that can be compared with other poets such as [[Robert Frost]], one of many well-known poets expressing himself with dark poetic works. The paradox taken from the [[Yin and Yang]] symbol in martial arts was also integrated into his poetry. His martial arts and philosophy contribute a great part to his poetry. The [[free verse]] form of Lee's poetry reflects his famous quote "Be formless&nbsp;... shapeless, like water."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Warrior Within |year=1996 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Martial arts-Philosophy |isbn=0-8092-3194-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/warriorwithinphi00litt/page/43 43] |author=John Little |editor=John Little |type=Book |chapter=Five: The Running Water|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/warriorwithinphi00litt/page/43}}</ref>

==Death==
[[File:Bruce Lee 1.JPG|thumb|Bruce Lee is buried next to his son [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]] at [[Lake View Cemetery (Seattle)|Lake View Cemetery]] in [[Seattle]].]]
On May 10, 1973, Lee collapsed during an [[automated dialogue replacement]] session for ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' at [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] in Hong Kong. Suffering from [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] and headaches, he was immediately rushed to [[Hong Kong Baptist Hospital]], where doctors diagnosed [[cerebral edema]]. They were able to reduce the swelling through the administration of [[mannitol]]. The headache and cerebral edema that occurred in his first collapse were later repeated on the day of his death.<ref name="collapse">{{harvnb|Thomas|1994}}</ref>

On July 20, 1973, Lee was in Hong Kong to have dinner with actor [[George Lazenby]], with whom he intended to make a film. According to Lee's wife Linda, Lee met producer [[Raymond Chow]] at 2&nbsp;p.m. at home to discuss the making of the film ''[[Game of Death]]''. They worked until 4&nbsp;p.m. and then drove together to the home of Lee's colleague [[Betty Ting Pei]], a Taiwanese actress. The three went over the script at Ting's home, and then Chow left to attend a dinner meeting.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2006|p=205}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1989|pp=156–157}}</ref>

Later, Lee complained of a headache, and Ting gave him the painkiller [[Equagesic]], which contained both [[aspirin]] and the tranquilizer [[meprobamate]]. Around 7:30&nbsp;p.m., he went to lie down for a nap. When Lee did not come for dinner, Chow came to the apartment, but he was unable to wake Lee up. A doctor was summoned, and spent ten minutes attempting to revive Lee before sending him by ambulance to [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]]. Lee was declared [[dead on arrival]], at the age of 32.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1068705/bruce-lees-kowloon-tong-residence-go-sale |title=Bruce Lee's residence |website=scmp}}</ref>

There was no visible external injury; however, according to autopsy reports, Lee's brain had swollen considerably, from 1,400 to 1,575 grams (a 13 percent increase). The autopsy found Equagesic in his system. On October 15, 2005, Chow stated in an interview that Lee died from an allergic reaction to the tranquilizer meprobamate, the main ingredient in Equagesic, which Chow described as an ingredient commonly used in painkillers. When the doctors announced Lee's death, it was officially ruled a "[[death by misadventure]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2006|p=206}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/02/26/stories/2006022605431400.htm |title=Bruce Lee died of seizure? |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=February 26, 2006 |accessdate=June 3, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829185520/http://www.hindu.com/2006/02/26/stories/2006022605431400.htm |archivedate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

These included murder involving the [[Triad (organized crime)|triads]] and a supposed curse on him and his family, rumors that persist to the present day.<ref>{{harvnb|Bishop|2004|p=157}}</ref>

[[Donald Teare]], a forensic scientist, recommended by [[Scotland Yard]], who had overseen over 1,000 autopsies, was assigned to the Lee case. His conclusion was "death by misadventure" caused by [[cerebral edema]] due to a reaction to compounds present in the combination medication Equagesic.<ref name="Thomas 1994 209">{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=209}}</ref> Although there was initial speculation that cannabis found in Lee's stomach may have contributed to his death, Teare refuted this, stating that it would "be both 'irresponsible and irrational' to say that [cannabis] might have triggered either the events of Bruce's collapse on May 10 or his death on July 20".<ref name="Thomas 1994 209" /> Dr. R. R. Lycette, the clinical pathologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, reported at the coroner hearing that the death could not have been caused by cannabis.<ref name="Thomas 1994 209" />

At the 1975 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] convention, Lee's friend [[Chuck Norris]] attributed his death to a reaction to the combination of the muscle-relaxant medication he had been taking since 1968 for a ruptured disc in his back and an "[[antibiotic]]" he was given for his headache on the night of his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ekAQfN8x8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106080521/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ekAQfN8x8|url-status=dead|title=Chuck Norris Explains What Really Killed Bruce Lee At The 1975 San Diego Comic-Con Convention|archivedate=November 6, 2014|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> In a 2017 episode of the [[Reelz]] TV series ''[[Autopsy: The Last Hours of...]]'', forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Hunter theorized that Lee died of [[adrenal crisis]] brought on by the overuse of [[cortisone]], which Lee had been taking since injuring his back in a 1970 weightlifting mishap.<ref name="hunter">"Autopsy: The Last Hours of Bruce Lee."

In a 2018 biography, author Matthew Polly consulted with medical experts and theorized that Lee died from [[cerebral edema]] caused by over-exertion and [[heat stroke]]; and heat stroke was not considered at the time because it was then a poorly-understood condition.{{sfn|Polly|2018|pp=473–475}} Furthermore, Lee had his underarm sweat glands removed in late 1972, in the apparent belief that underarm sweat was unphotogenic on film.<ref name="hunter" /> Polly further theorized that this caused Lee's body to overheat while practicing in hot temperatures on May 10 and July 20, 1973, resulting in heat stroke that in turn exacerbated the cerebral edema that led to his death.{{sfn|Polly|2018|pp=473–475}}

The concept of mixed martial arts was popularized in the West by Bruce Lee via his system of Jeet Kune Do. Lee believed that "the best fighter is not a Boxer, Karate or Judo man. The best fighter is someone who can adapt to any style, to be formless, to adopt an individual's own style and not following the system of styles." In 2004, [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) founder [[Dana White]] called Lee the "father of mixed martial arts" and stated: "If you look at the way Bruce Lee trained, the way he fought, and many of the things he wrote, he said the perfect style was no style. You take a little something from everything. You take the good things from every different discipline, use what works, and you throw the rest away".<ref>Wickert, Marc. 2004. ''Dana White and the future of UFC''. kucklepit.com. See [[wikiquote:Dana White|Wikiquotes]] for the text.</ref> Numerous fighters in [[combat sports]] were inspired by Lee.

Lee was named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most influential people of the 20th century]].<ref name="Time 100" /> In April 2013, he was posthumously awarded the prestigious Founders Award at [[The Asian Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bollyspice.com/57703/asian-awards-winners-night-event |title=Special Report: Asian Awards 2013 |date=April 18, 2013 |publisher=}}</ref>

A theme park dedicated to Lee was built in [[Jun'an, Guangdong]]. Mainland Chinese only started watching Bruce Lee films in the 1980s, when videos of classic movies like ''[[Fist of Fury|The Chinese Connection]]'' became available. Films like ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' and ''[[The Big Boss|Fists of Fury]]'' were banned by Mao as spiritual pollution and rightist sentimentality.<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/new-generation-of-kung-fu-crazy-chinese-discovering-bruce-lee-1.896517 New generation of kung fu crazy Chinese discovering Bruce Lee] (October 16, 2008)</ref>

==Martial arts lineage==
{{relevance inline|date=December 2018}}

Lee was trained in Wu Tai Chi Chuan (also known as Ng-ga) and Jing Mo Tam Tui for the twelve sets. Lee was trained in the martial arts [[Choy Li Fut]], [[Boxing|Western Boxing]], [[Fencing|Épée fencing]], Judo, Praying Mantis kung fu, Hsing-I, and Jujitsu.

{{quote|"When Bruce arrived in the US he (already) had training in Wu Style Tai Chi, sometimes in Hong Kong called Ng-ga. And he had of course training in western boxing. He had training in fencing from his brother, that's Epee, that goes from toe to head. He had training obviously in Wing Chun. And the other area was the training he had received in Buk Pie, or Tam Toi, he was twelve sets in Tam Toi. And I believe he had traded with a Choy Li Fut man."|Danny Inosanto<ref>Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do, 1995 Legacy Productions, New Zealand.</ref>}}

===Certified instructors===
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2018}}Bruce Lee personally certified only three instructors: [[Taky Kimura]], [[James Yimm Lee]], and [[Dan Inosanto]]. Taky Kimura holds a 5th rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu. James Yimm Lee held a 3rd rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu. Inosanto holds the 3rd rank (Instructor) directly from Bruce Lee in Jeet Kune Do, Jun Fan Gung Fu, and Bruce Lee's Tao of Chinese Gung Fu. Other Jeet Kune Do instructors since Lee's death have been certified directly by Dan Inosanto, some with remaining Bruce Lee-signed certificates.

James Yimm Lee, a close friend of Lee, certified a few students including Gary Dill, who studied Jeet Kune Do under James and received permission via a personal letter from him in 1972 to pass on his learning of Jun Fan Gung Fu to others. [[Taky Kimura]], to date, has certified only one person in Jun Fan Gung Fu: his son Andy Kimura. Dan Inosanto continued to teach and certify select students in [[Jeet Kune Do]] for over 30 years, making it possible for thousands of martial arts practitioners to trace their training lineage back to Bruce Lee. Prior to his death, Lee told his then only two living instructors Kimura and Inosanto (James Yimm Lee had died in 1972) to dismantle his schools. Both [[Taky Kimura]] and Dan Inosanto were allowed to teach small classes thereafter, under the guideline "keep the numbers low, but the quality high".

Bruce also instructed several [[World Karate Champion]]s including [[Chuck Norris]], [[Joe Lewis (martial artist)|Joe Lewis]], and [[Mike Stone (karate)|Mike Stone]].  Between the three of them, during their training with Bruce, they won every karate championship in the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Little|2001|p=211}}</ref>

In Japan, [[Junichi Okada]] is a certified Japanese instructor in Jeet Kune Do.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tokyohive.com/2010/09/v6-okada-junichi-now-a-martial-arts-instructor/ |title=V6 Okada Junichi now a martial arts instructor |date=September 10, 2010 |publisher=Tokyo Hive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229085958/http://www.tokyohive.com/2010/09/v6-okada-junichi-now-a-martial-arts-instructor/ |archivedate=February 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |accessdate=January 15, 2012 }}</ref>

After his match with [[Wong Jack Man]] in 1965, Lee changed his approach toward martial arts training. Lee felt that many martial artists of his time did not spend enough time on physical conditioning. Lee included all elements of total fitness—muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility. He used traditional [[bodybuilding]] techniques to build some muscle mass, though not overdone, as that could decrease speed or flexibility. At the same time, with respect to balance, Lee maintained that mental and spiritual preparation are fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills. In ''[[Tao of Jeet Kune Do]]'' he wrote:

{{quote|Training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics. Too much time is given to the development of skill and too little to the development of the individual for participation.&nbsp;... JKD, ultimately is not a matter of petty techniques but of highly developed spirituality and physique.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=May 30, 2008 |url=http://www.hybridmartialart.com/Martial%20Art%20Overview/Martial_%20Arts_%20Overview.html |title=Martial Art Disciplines at Hybrid Martial Arts Academy |publisher=Hybrid Martial Art |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430001936/http://www.hybridmartialart.com/Martial%20Art%20Overview/Martial_%20Arts_%20Overview.html |archivedate=April 30, 2008}}</ref>}}

According to [[Linda Lee Cadwell]], soon after he moved to the United States, Lee started to take nutrition seriously and developed an interest in health foods, high-protein drinks, and vitamin and mineral supplements. He later concluded that achieving a high-performance body was akin to maintaining the engine of a high-performance automobile. Allegorically, as one could not keep a car running on low-octane fuels, one could not sustain one's body with a steady diet of junk food, and with "the wrong fuel", one's body would perform sluggishly or sloppily.<ref>{{harvnb|Little|1998|p=162}}</ref> Lee also avoided baked goods and refined flour, describing them as providing empty calories that did nothing for his body.<ref>{{harvnb|Little|1998|p=163}}</ref> He was known for being a fan of Asian cuisine for its variety, and often ate meals with a combination of vegetables, rice, and fish. Lee had a dislike for dairy products and as a result, used powdered milk in his diet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/nov/28/fit-as-a-fiddle-bruce-lees-diet-and-fitness-routine-1904397.html#:~:text=Here%20are%20some%20tips%20from%20Bruce%20Lee%27s%20diet%20plan%3A&text=He%20was%20fond%20of%20steak,tofu%20and%20above%20all%2C%20vegetables.|title=Inspirational!

== Personal ==

=== Names ===
Lee's [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] birth name was ''[[Li (李)|Lee]] Jun-fan'' ({{lang|zh|李振藩}}).<ref name="Bio-TBLS">振藩; Mandarin [[Pinyin]]: Zhènfán) {{harvnb|Lee|1989}}</ref> The name homophonically means "return again", and was given to Lee by his mother, who felt he would return to the United States once he came of age.<ref name="TheBruceLeeStory20">{{harvnb|Lee|1989|p=20}}</ref> Because of his mother's superstitious nature, she had originally named him ''Sai-fon'' ({{lang|zh|細鳳}}), which is a feminine name meaning "small [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]".<ref name="Bruce Lee 2002">Bruce Lee: the immortal Dragon, January 29, 2002, A&E Television Networks</ref> The English name "Bruce" is thought to have been given by the hospital attending physician, Dr. Mary Glover.<ref name="Bio-BLTUS">{{cite book|title=Bruce Lee The Untold Story|last=Lee|first=Grace|publisher=CFW Enterprise|year=1980|location=United States}}</ref>

Lee had three other Chinese names: Lee Yuen-cham ({{lang|zh|李源鑫}}), a family/clan name; Lee Yuen-kam ({{lang|zh|李元鑒}}), which he used as a student name while he was attending [[La Salle College]], and his Chinese screen name Lee Siu-lung ({{lang|zh|李小龍}}; ''Siu-lung'' means "little dragon").{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Lee's given name Jun-fan was originally written in Chinese as {{lang|zh|震藩}}; however, the ''Jun'' ({{lang|zh|震}}) [[Chinese character]] was identical to part of his grandfather's name, Lee Jun-biu ({{lang|zh|李震彪}}).{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Hence, the Chinese character for ''Jun'' in Lee's name was changed to the [[homonym]] {{lang|zh|振}} instead, to avoid [[naming taboo]] in Chinese tradition.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

===Family===
[[File:Bruce Lee and his family 1940s.jpg|thumb|Lee and his family]]
Lee's father, [[Lee Hoi-chuen]], was one of the leading [[Cantonese opera]] and film actors at the time and was embarking on a year-long opera tour with his family on the eve of the [[Battle of Hong Kong|Japanese invasion of Hong Kong]]. Lee Hoi-chuen had been touring the United States for many years and performing in numerous Chinese communities there.

Although many of his peers decided to stay in the US, Lee Hoi-chuen returned to Hong Kong after Bruce's birth. Within months, Hong Kong was invaded and the Lees lived for three years and eight months under [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]]. After the war ended, Lee Hoi-chuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actor during Hong Kong's rebuilding years.

Lee's mother, Grace Ho, was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in Hong Kong, the Ho-tungs. She was the half-niece of [[Robert Ho|Sir Robert Ho-tung]],<ref name="People's Republic of China">{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/147meeting/AAB-46%20Annex%20B.pdf|title=Kom Tong Hall at 7 Castle Road, Mid-levels, Hong Kong|publisher=People's Republic of China|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612034159/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/147meeting/AAB-46%20Annex%20B.pdf|archivedate=June 12, 2011|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/History/en/pspecial_8.php|title=Kom Tong Hall and the Dr Sun Yat-sen Museum|date=January 10, 2005|publisher=People's Republic of China|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818100840/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/History/en/pspecial_8.php|archivedate=August 18, 2010|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}</ref> the Eurasian patriarch of the clan. As such, the young Bruce Lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment. Despite the advantage of his family's status, the neighborhood in which Lee grew up became overcrowded, dangerous, and full of gang rivalries due to an influx of refugees fleeing [[China|communist China]] for Hong Kong, at that time a British [[Crown Colony]].<ref name="Bruce Lee 2002" />

Grace Ho is reported as either the adopted or biological daughter of Ho Kom-tong (Ho Gumtong, {{lang|zh|何甘棠}}) and the half-niece of [[Robert Ho|Sir Robert Ho-tung]], both notable Hong Kong businessmen and philanthropists.<ref name="People's Republic of China" /> Bruce was the fourth of five children: Phoebe Lee ({{lang|zh|李秋源}}), Agnes Lee ({{lang|zh|李秋鳳}}), [[Peter Lee Jung-sum|Peter Lee]], and [[Robert Lee Jun-fai|Robert Lee]].

Grace's parentage remains unclear. Linda Lee, in her 1989 biography ''The Bruce Lee Story'', suggests that Grace had a German father and was a Catholic.<ref name="harvnb|Lee|1989" /> Bruce Thomas, in his influential 1994 biography ''Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit'', suggests that Grace had a Chinese mother and a German father.<ref name="Russo">{{cite news|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/was-bruce-lee-of-english-descent|title=Was Bruce Lee of English Descent?|last=Russo|first=Charles|date=May 18, 2016|work=VICE Fightland|access-date=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025083142/http://fightland.vice.com/blog/was-bruce-lee-of-english-descent|archivedate=October 25, 2016|location=}}</ref> Lee's relative Eric Peter Ho, in his 2010 book ''Tracing My Children's Lineage'', suggests that Grace was born in [[Shanghai]] to a [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] woman named Cheung King-sin.<ref name="Russo" /> Eric Peter Ho said that Grace Lee was the daughter of a mixed race Shanghainese woman and her father was Ho Kom Tong.

In the 2018 biography ''Bruce Lee: A Life'', [[Matthew Polly]] identifies Lee's maternal grandfather as Ho Kom-tong, who had often been reported as his adoptive grandfather. Ho's father, Mozes Hartog Bosman, was a Dutch Jewish businessman from [[Rotterdam]].{{sfn|Polly|2018|pp=12–15}} He moved to Hong Kong with the [[Dutch East India Company]] and served as the Dutch consul to Hong Kong at one time.
