===Producing===
Cruise partnered with his former talent agent [[Paula Wagner]] to form [[Cruise/Wagner Productions]] in 1993,<ref name="MGM">{{cite news|title=MGM Partners With Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner to Form New United Artists |url=http://sev.prnewswire.com/entertainment/20061102/LATH10602112006-1.html |agency=PR Newswire |publisher=Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios |date=November 2, 2006 |quote= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929115013/http://sev.prnewswire.com/entertainment/20061102/LATH10602112006-1.html |archivedate=September 29, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise's films, the first being ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' in 1996 which was also Cruise's first project as a producer.

Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist [[Edward Jay Epstein]] as "one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood." Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being [[George Lucas]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise's tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise's exceptional commercial prowess.<ref name="Epstein">{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|authorlink=Edward Jay Epstein|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2121617/ |title=Tom Cruise Inc. |website=Slate.com|accessdate=October 31, 2008}}</ref>

Cruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise's film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on [[Erik Larson (author)|Erik Larson]]'s ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller, ''[[The Devil in the White City]]'' about a real-life serial killer, [[H. H. Holmes]], at Chicago's [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. [[Kathryn Bigelow]] is attached to the project to produce and helm. Meanwhile, [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s production company, Appian Way, is also developing a film about Holmes and the [[World's Fair]], in which DiCaprio will star.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thezreview.co.uk/comingsoon/d/devilinthewhitecitythe.htm |title=The Devil In The White City movie, trailer, review, pics, pictures, poster, news, DVD|website=Thezreview.co.uk |accessdate=October 31, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080705065258/http://www.thezreview.co.uk/comingsoon/d/devilinthewhitecitythe.htm |archivedate = July 5, 2008}}</ref>

Cruise has produced several films in which he appeared. He produced ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[Without Limits]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]'', ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]'', ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' and many others.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/|title=Tom Cruise Production Credits|website=IMDb.com|access-date=January 22, 2016}}</ref>

====Break with Paramount====
On August 22, 2006, [[Paramount Pictures]] announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', chairman of [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]] (Paramount's parent company) [[Sumner Redstone]] cited the economic damage to Cruise's value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/08/22/news/newsmakers/cruise_paramount/index.htm?cnn=yes |title=CNN: Paramount Pictures cuts ties with Tom Cruise |publisher=CNN  |date=August 23, 2006 |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_27267912.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015319/http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_27267912.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=Sumner Redstone Rebuke of Tom Cruise: Now What? |publisher=National Ledger |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}</ref> Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount's announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from [[private equity]] firms.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lieberman |first=David |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2006-08-23-hedge-films-usat_x.htm |title=Cruise seeks financial backing from hedge funds |work=USA Today |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}</ref>

Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount's discontent over Cruise/Wagner's exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the ''Mission: Impossible'' franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d817b680-33a0-11db-981f-0000779e2340.html|title=Paramount vs Cruise: all down to the killer cut|work=Financial Times|accessdate=April 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nicole |last=Sperling |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003052563 |title=Biz eyeing economics of Cruise-Par breakup: DVD slowdown forcing restraint |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113093430/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003052563 |archivedate=January 13, 2009 }}</ref>

====Management of United Artists====
In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio [[United Artists]].<ref name="MGM"/> Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA's chief executive.

Production began in 2007 of ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'', a thriller based on the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against [[Adolf Hitler]]. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007, Cruise signed to play [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], the [[protagonist]]. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'', directed by [[Robert Redford]] and starring Redford, [[Meryl Streep]] and Cruise. ''Lambs'' was released on November 9, 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/3/21/73153.shtml?s=en |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712180209/http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/3/21/73153.shtml?s=en |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |title=Tom Cruise Takes on Adolf Hitler |website=Newsmax.com |date=March 21, 2007 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref> opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.

In August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise's share amounts to 30 percent of the studio.<ref>[https://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/14/business/fi-wagner14 Paula Wagner plans to step down at United Artists], an August 2008 article from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref>

Cruise met his second wife, actress [[Nicole Kidman]], on the set of their film ''[[Days of Thunder]]'' (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. They adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995). In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. The pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. In 2007, Kidman clarified rumors of a miscarriage early in her marriage to Cruise, saying that it was wrongly reported and explaining that she had actually had an [[ectopic pregnancy]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gordon |first=Meryl |url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/Nicole-Kidman-Interview-3 |title=Nicole Kidman Tells It Like It Is |work=Marie Claire |date=November 11, 2007 |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref>

For such activities, Scientology leader [[David Miscavige]] created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004.<ref name="vanity">{{cite web |title= What Katie Didn't Know |work= [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date= October 2012 |author= Maureen Orth |url= https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2012/10/katie-holmes-divorce-scientology}}</ref>

====Criticism of psychiatry====
In January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement "I think psychiatry should be outlawed."<ref name=Desai>{{cite journal|last=Desai|first=Nimesh|title=Antipsychiatry: Meeting the challenge|journal=[[Indian Journal of Psychiatry]] |date=October–December 2005|volume=47|issue=4|pages=185–187|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.43048|pmid=20711302|pmc=2921130}}</ref> Further controversy erupted in 2005 after he openly criticized actress [[Brooke Shields]] for using the drug [[Paxil]] (paroxetine), an [[anti-depressant]] to which Shields attributes her recovery from [[postpartum depression]] after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of [[pseudoscience]]. Shields responded that Cruise "should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Brooke Shields Lashes Out at Tom Cruise|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1067822,00.html|date=June 2, 2005|work= [[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}</ref> This led to a heated argument between [[Matt Lauer]] and Cruise on NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' on June 24, 2005.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8344309/ |title= In tense moment, Cruise calls Lauer 'glib'| website=[[NBC News]]| date= June 28, 2005}}</ref>

Medical authorities view Cruise's comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Psychotropic drugs: unhelpful and helpful comments| journal=[[The Lancet]] | publisher=[[Elsevier]]|location=London, England|volume=366| issue=9480| page=96| date= July 9, 2005 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66841-9 | pmid= 16010708| last1=The Lancet }}</ref> Shields herself called Cruise's comments "a disservice to mothers everywhere."<ref>{{cite news|last=Shields |first=Brooke|authorlink=Brooke Shields |work= The New York Times|title=War of Words |date=July 1, 2005 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/01/opinion/01shields.html | accessdate=January 20, 2009 }}</ref> In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Shields: Cruise apology was 'heartfelt{{'-}}|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-09-02-shields-cruise_x.htm|date=September 2, 2006|work=[[USA Today]]|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=June 20, 2011}}</ref>

Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and the [[psychoactive drug]]s which are routinely prescribed for treatment.<ref name="vanity"/>  It was reported that Cruise's anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.myway.com/celebgossip/pgsix/id/09_21_2005_1.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050930235723/http://entertainment.myway.com/celebgossip/pgsix/id/09_21_2005_1.html| title=Spielberg in Cruise Meltdown|archivedate=September 30, 2005|work=myway.com}}</ref> Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise's presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor's office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/07/24/hollywood-ending|title=Hollywood Ending|first= Ken |last= Auletta|date=July 24, 2006|work= [[The New Yorker]]}}</ref>

====YouTube video removal====
{{main|Project Chanology#Tom Cruise video}}
On January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him.<ref name="warne">{{cite news | last =Warne | first =Dan | title ='Anonymous' threatens to 'dismantle' Church of Scientology via internet | work=[[APC Magazine]] | publisher=[[National Nine News]] | date =January 24, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="knbc">{{cite news | title =Hacker Group Declares War On Scientology: Group Upset Over Church's Handling Of Tom Cruise Video | publisher=[[KNBC]] |location=Los Angeles| date =January 24, 2008 | url =http://www.knbc.com/news/15132759/detail.html | accessdate =January 25, 2008 }}</ref> The Church of Scientology said the video had been "pirated and edited," and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology.<ref name="knbc" /><ref name="Church of Scientology Slams German Tabloid">{{cite news | title =Report: Church of Scientology Slams German Tabloid for Publishing Comments Comparing Tom Cruise to Nazi Minister | publisher =[[Fox News]] | date =January 23, 2008 | url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,324885,00.html | accessdate =January 25, 2008 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090605211418/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,324885,00.html | archive-date =June 5, 2009 | url-status=dead | df =mdy-all }}</ref> YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.<ref name="vamosi anonymous hackers">{{cite news | last =Vamosi | first =Robert | title =Anonymous hackers take on the Church of Scientology | work=[[CNET News]] | publisher=CNET Networks, Inc. | date =January 24, 2008 | url =http://www.news.com/8301-10789_3-9857666-57.html | accessdate =January 25, 2008 }}</ref>

After YouTube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the [[fair use]] clause. It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of June 2020, the video has achieved over 14 million views. YouTube has declined to remove it again, due to the popularity of the video, and subsequent changes to copyright policy of the Web site.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFBZ_uAbxS0 Tom Cruise Scientology Video – (Original UNCUT)].

====Scientology's purported influence on Cruise====
{{see also|#Personal life}}
In 2013, Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple's daughter Suri from Scientology. He also said that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the church.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tom Cruise Admits Katie Holmes Divorced Him To Protect Suri From Scientology|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/08/tom-cruise-katie-holmes-protect-suri-scientology_n_4240715.html?ir=Entertainment | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | first=Stephanie|last=Marcus|date=November 8, 2013}}</ref>

In March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise's next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, Cruise's sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117932447?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Cruise will go with pro|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Chris|last=Gardner|date= November 6, 2005|accessdate=October 31, 2008}}</ref> DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm [[Rogers & Cowan|Rogers and Cowan]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/eo/20051108/113151894008.html|title=Cruise Control Shifts Gears|date=November 8, 2005|work=Yahoo!

The 2015 documentary ''[[Going Clear (film)|Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief]]'' cast a spotlight on Cruise's role in Scientology. The film alleges that Cruise used [[Sea Org]] workers as a source of free labor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tom-cruises-secret-scientology-girlfriend-nazanin-boniadi-2015-3|title=Tom Cruise's secret Scientology girlfriend Nazanin Boniadi|date=April 1, 2015|work=Business Insider}}</ref> In the film, Cruise's former auditor [[Marty Rathbun]] claims that wife [[Nicole Kidman]] was wiretapped on Tom Cruise's suggestion (which Cruise's lawyer denies).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11370754/Scientology-leaders-ordered-Nicole-Kidman-wiretap-during-Tom-Cruise-marriage.html|title=Scientology leaders 'ordered Nicole Kidman wiretap' during Tom Cruise marriage|date=January 26, 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/618897/controversial-scientology-documentary-alleges-tom-cruise-wiretapped-nicole-kidman-s-phone-church-slams-claims|title=Controversial Scientology Documentary Alleges Tom Cruise Wiretapped Nicole Kidman's Phone, Church Slams Claims|work=E!

==="Tom Cruise Picture"===
While reviewing ''[[Days of Thunder]]'', film critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted the similarities between several of Cruise's 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the Tom Cruise Picture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/days-of-thunder-1990|title=Days Of Thunder movie review & film summary (1990) &#124; Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com|accessdate=May 21, 2020}}</ref> Some of Cruise's later films like ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' and ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' can also be considered to be part of this formula.

''Widescreenings'' noted that for Tom Cruise's character Daniel Kaffee in ''[[A Few Good Men]]'',
<blockquote>
[screenwriter] [[Aaron Sorkin]] interestingly takes the opposite approach of ''[[Top Gun]]'', where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In ''Top Gun'', Cruise plays Mitchell who is a 'hot shot' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do.<ref name="widescreenings">{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenings.com/few-good-men-analysis-review.html|title=Review and analysis: A Few Good Men|first=Inspired by R.

</blockquote>
Sorkin and director [[Rob Reiner]] are praised in gradually unveiling Kaffee's potential in the film.<ref name="widescreenings"/>

==Litigation==
In 1998, Tom Cruise successfully sued the ''[[Daily Express]]'', a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a [[sham marriage|sham]] designed to cover up his homosexuality.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/203779.stm |title=Cruise and Kidman win libel case |work=BBC News |date=October 29, 1998 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref> Cruise won the libel case.

In May 2001, Cruise filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had told the celebrity magazine ''[[Actustar]]'' that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise,<ref>{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Simon|title=Cruise sues porn star over gay love claims|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1329163/Cruise-sues-porn-star-over-gay-love-claims.html|accessdate=May 6, 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=May 4, 2001|location=London}}</ref> and Slater was later ordered to pay $10&nbsp;million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default. Cruise requested a default judgment and, in January 2003, a Los Angeles judge decided against Slater after the porn actor said that his story was false.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/2664159.stm |title=Cruise wins 'gay' claims legal battle |work=BBC News |date=January 16, 2003 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |first=Stephen|last=Silverman|url=https://people.com/celebrity/cruise-wins-10-million-in-gay-lawsuit/ |title=Cruise Wins $10 Million in Gay Lawsuit |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=January 16, 2003 |accessdate=February 17, 2019}}</ref>

Cruise also sued ''Bold Magazine'' publisher Michael Davis for $100&nbsp;million, because Davis had alleged (though never confirmed) that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/1686039.stm |title=Cruise gay claims dropped |work=BBC News |date=December 1, 2001 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, Cruise sued [[cybersquatting|cybersquatter]] Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|author=Arbitration and Mediation Center |url=http://arbiter.wipo.int/domains/decisions/html/2006/d2006-0560.html |title=WIPO Domain Name Decision: D2006-0560 |website=Arbiter.wipo.int |date=July 5, 2006 |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}</ref>

In 2009, Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise's behest. That suit was dismissed by a Central Civil West court judge in Los Angeles on the grounds that the [[statute of limitations]] had expired on Sapir's claim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebuzz.com/2012-07-06/tom-cruise-accused-of-wiretap-conspiracy-with-convicted-criminal-anthony-pellicano-during-nicole-kidman-divorce-exclusive/|title=Tom Cruise Accused of Wiretap Conspiracy With Convicted Criminal Anthony Pellicano During Nicole Kidman Divorce|work=Celebuzz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/tom-cruise-bert-fields-win-dismissal-wiretapping-suit-81691/|title=Tom Cruise, Bert Fields Win Dismissal of Pellicano Wiretapping Suit|work=TheWrap}}</ref>

In October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against ''[[In Touch Weekly|In Touch]]'' and ''[[Life & Style (magazine)|Life & Style]]'' magazines for [[defamation]] after they claimed Cruise had "abandoned" his six-year-old daughter.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.tmz.com/2012/10/24/tom-cruise-50-million-dollar-lawsuit-life-and-style-abandoned-suri/ | title=Tom Cruise Files $50 Mil Lawsuit Over Mag Claiming He Abandoned Suri  | date=October 24, 2012 |work=TMZ | accessdate=October 24, 2012}}</ref> During deposition, Cruise testified that due to his work load 110 days had passed without him seeing her.
