==Career==
=== Music ===
Wahlberg first came to fame as the younger brother of [[Donnie Wahlberg]] of the successful [[boy band]], ''[[New Kids on the Block]]''. Mark, at the age of 13, was one of the group's original members, along with Donnie, but quit after a few months. [[Danny Wood]], [[Jordan Knight]], [[Jonathan Knight]] and [[Joey McIntyre]] all joined the group after Mark had left.

In 1990, Wahlberg began recording with dancers/rappers Scott Ross (Scottie Gee), Hector Barros (Hector the Booty Inspector), Anthony Thomas (Ashley Ace), and Terry Yancey (DJ-T) as [[Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch]], earning a hit with "[[Good Vibrations (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch song)|Good Vibrations]]" from their debut album ''[[Music for the People (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch album)|Music for the People]]''. The record, produced by brother Donnie, hit number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], later becoming certified as a [[Platinum Single|platinum single]]. The second single, "[[Wildside (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch song)|Wildside]]", peaked at number five on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Hot Singles Sales]] chart and at number 10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} It was certified as a gold single. Marky Mark opened for the New Kids on the Block during their last tour. Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch also had their own video game, titled ''[[Make My Video (series)|Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch: Make My Video]]'', which despite the band's success, was a huge flop.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Townsend |first=Emru |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/127579-6/the_10_worst_games_of_all_time.html |title=The 10 Worst Games of All Time – Page 6 |magazine=PCWorld |date=March 14, 2012 |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413105301/http://www.pcworld.com/article/127579-6/the_10_worst_games_of_all_time.html |archive-date=April 13, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/segacd/587969-marky-mark-and-the-funky-bunch-make-my-video/ |title=Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch: Make My Video for Sega CD |publisher=GameRankings |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014093707/http://www.gamerankings.com/segacd/587969-marky-mark-and-the-funky-bunch-make-my-video/ |archive-date=October 14, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The second Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch LP, ''[[You Gotta Believe]]'', was not as successful as the first, yielding only a minor hit single in the title track.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r60116/review|first=Ron|last=Wynn}}</ref>

In December 1992, while performing on the British TV show ''[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]]'', Wahlberg praised [[Shabba Ranks]], who had stated gays should be crucified. [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] condemned him and berated Calvin Klein for using him to promote their products.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/pin-up-exposed-why-marky-mark-is-taking-the-rap-the-man-wearing-calvin-kleins-pants-could-be-undone-2322005.html|title=Pin-up exposed: why Marky Mark is taking the rap: The man wearing Calvin Klein's pants could be undone by his shady past and unguarded remarks.

Wahlberg later collaborated with the late reggae/[[ragga]] singer [[Prince Ital Joe]] on the album ''[[Life in the Streets]]''.
