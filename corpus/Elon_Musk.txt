Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in [[Pretoria]], South Africa. He briefly attended the [[University of Pretoria]] before moving to [[Canada]] when he was 17 to attend [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]]. He transferred to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] two years later, where he received a [[bachelor's degree]] in economics from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]] and a bachelor's degree in physics from the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]]. He moved to California in 1995 to begin a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at [[Stanford University]], but decided to pursue a business career instead of enrolling. He co-founded (with his brother [[Kimbal Musk|Kimbal]]) [[Zip2]], a web software company, which was acquired by [[Compaq]] for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded [[X.com]], an online bank. It merged with [[Confinity]] in 2000, which had launched [[PayPal]] the previous year and was subsequently bought by [[eBay]] for $1.5 billion in October 2002.

In May 2002, Musk founded [[SpaceX]], an [[aerospace]] manufacturer and [[space]] transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He joined Tesla Motors, Inc. (now [[Tesla, Inc.]]), an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded, became its product architect, and became its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create [[SolarCity]], a solar energy services company (now a subsidiary of Tesla). In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote [[friendly artificial intelligence]]. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a [[neurotechnology]] company focused on developing [[brain–computer interface]]s. In December 2016, Musk founded [[The Boring Company]], an infrastructure and tunnel construction company focused on tunnels optimized for electric vehicles.

In addition to his primary business pursuits, Musk has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the [[Hyperloop]]. Musk has said the goals of SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity revolve around his vision to "change the world and help humanity".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgKWPdJWuBQ|title=The mind behind Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity ... &#124; Elon Musk|via=youtube.com}}</ref> His goals include reducing [[global warming]] through [[sustainable energy]] production and consumption, and lessening the [[existential risk|risk]] of [[human extinction]] by establishing a [[Colonization of Mars|human colony on Mars]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Ross|last=Andersen|url=https://aeon.co/essays/elon-musk-puts-his-case-for-a-multi-planet-civilisation |title=Elon Musk puts his case for a multi-planet civilisation |website=Aeon|date=September 30, 2014 |accessdate=February 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1HZIQliuoA|title=Elon Musk – the Future of Energy & Transport at Oxford Martin School|date=November 22, 2012|accessdate=December 7, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Statt|first=Nick |date=March 11, 2018 |title=Elon Musk still thinks a Mars colony will save us from a future dark age|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/11/17106910/elon-musk-ai-threat-mars-moon-colonization-nukes-sxsw-2018|access-date=July 31, 2020 |website=The Verge|language=en}}</ref>

Musk has described the United States as "[inarguably] the greatest country that has ever existed on Earth," describing it as "the greatest force for good of any country that's ever been."

In August 2019, Musk came out on Twitter in support of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate [[Andrew Yang]], whose platform revolves around the ongoing problem of job displacement through technological automation and artificial intelligence.

==== Subsidies ====
Musk has stated that he does not believe the U.S. government should provide [[subsidies]] to companies but should instead use a [[carbon tax]] to price in the negative [[externality]] of [[climate change]] and discourage poor behavior. Musk says that the [[free market]] would achieve the best solution, and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://qz.com/564782/elon-musk-says-tax-free-carbon-is-the-dumbest-experiment-in-history/|title=Elon Musk says tax-free carbon is "the dumbest experiment in history"|last1=Werber|first1=Cassie|work=Quartz|accessdate=August 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200826161408/https://qz.com/564782/elon-musk-says-tax-free-carbon-is-the-dumbest-experiment-in-history/|archive-date=August 26, 2020}}</ref>

Musk's statements have been criticized, with [[Stanford University]] Professor [[Fred Turner (author)|Fred Turner]] noting that "if you're an entrepreneur like Elon Musk, you will take the money where you can get it, but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that it's entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of [[social change]], not the state. It is not quite self-delusion, but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a free-standing, independent agent, and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received. And this goes on all the time in Silicon Valley."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/10/tesla-motors-free-ride-elon-musk-government-subsidies|title=Taxpayer Subsidies Helped Tesla Motors, So Why Does Elon Musk Slam Them?|website=Mother Jones|accessdate=April 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200616165121/https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/10/tesla-motors-free-ride-elon-musk-government-subsidies/|archive-date=June 16, 2020}}</ref> Author [[Michael Shellenberger]] argued that "in the case of Musk, it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness. And I think there is a business reason for it. They are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a long-term viable business, and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent." Shellenberger continues, "we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful, a bit more humble." While journalist and author [[Jim Motavalli]], who interviewed Musk for ''High Voltage'', his 2011 book about the electric vehicle industry, speculated that "Elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner, and he doesn't want to see other people win because they get government money—I do think there is a tendency of people, once they have succeeded, to want to pull the ladder up after them."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/10/tesla-motors-free-ride-elon-musk-government-subsidies?page=2|title=Taxpayer Subsidies Helped Tesla Motors, So Why Does Elon Musk Slam Them?|last=Harkinson|first=Josh|date=September 2013|website=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|accessdate=June 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200621135803/https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/10/tesla-motors-free-ride-elon-musk-government-subsidies/2/|archive-date=June 21, 2020}}</ref>

In 2015, Musk's statements were subject to further scrutiny when an ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article claimed that [[SpaceX]], Tesla, [[SolarCity]] and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated {{US$|4.9&nbsp;billion}} in government subsidies over twenty years. One example given is New York state, which is spending $750&nbsp;million to build a solar panel factory in Buffalo which will be leased to SolarCity for $1 a year. The deal also includes no property taxes for a decade, an estimated $260&nbsp;million valuation. Tesla's former vice president of business development and former U.S. State Department official, Diarmuid O’Connell, was the automaker's lead negotiator.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html#page=1|title=Elon Musk's growing empire is fuelled by &nbsp;billion in government subsidies|last=Hirsch|first=Jerry|date=May 30, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200826065353/https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html|archive-date=August 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/13/teslas-vice-president-of-business-development-leaves.html|title=Tesla’s vice president of business development leaves|last=Ferris|first=Harris|date=September 13, 2017|website=cnbc.com|accessdate=May 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823163400/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/13/teslas-vice-president-of-business-development-leaves.html|archive-date=August 23, 2020}}</ref>

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Musk has frequently spoken about the [[existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|potential dangers]] of [[artificial intelligence]], calling it "the most serious threat to the survival of the human race". During a 2014 interview at the [[MIT]] AeroAstro Centennial Symposium, Musk described AI as humanity's largest [[existential threat]], further stating, "I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish." Musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as "summoning the demon".<ref name="guardianAI">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat |title=Elon Musk: artificial intelligence is our biggest existential threat |first1=Samuel |last1=Gibbs |date=October 27, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=December 15, 2015}}</ref><ref name="wp2015">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/07/28/elon-musk-and-stephen-hawking-think-we-should-ban-killer-robots/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308074506/http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/07/28/elon-musk-and-stephen-hawking-think-we-should-ban-killer-robots/ |title=Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking think we should ban killer robots |date=July 28, 2015 |archivedate=March 8, 2016 |website=Washington Post |accessdate=January 5, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Musk's opinions about artificial intelligence have brought him some controversy. He and [[Facebook]] founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]] have clashed, with the latter calling his warnings "pretty irresponsible".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/24/mark-zuckerberg-elon-musks-doomsday-ai-predictions-are-irresponsible.html|title=Mark Zuckerberg: Elon Musk's doomsday AI predictions are irresponsible|last=Clifford|first=Catherine|date=July 24, 2017|website=cnbc.com|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> Musk responded to Zuckerberg's censure by saying that following a discussion he had about AI with Zuckerberg he was of the opinion that Mark had only a "limited understanding" of the subject.

<blockquote>I think public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn't leave where [sic] you want it to leave, doesn't start where you want it to start, doesn't end where you want it to end? And it doesn't go all the time. [...] It's a pain in the ass. That's why everyone doesn't like it. And there's like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer, OK, great. And so that's why people like individualized transport, that goes where you want, when you want.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/39433-elon-musk-sparks-heated-twitter-debate-over-boring-company-s-vision|title=Elon Musk Sparks Heated Twitter Debate Over Boring Company's Vision|last=Brown|first=Mike|date=December 15, 2017|work=Inverse|access-date=December 23, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

Afterwards, he dismissed an audience member's response that public transportation functioned effectively in Japan.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/dec/21/elon-musk-public-transport-transit-painful-twitter|title='I met my wife on a train platform': Twitter responds to Elon Musk with positive public transport stories|last=Hunt|first=Elle|date=December 21, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=December 23, 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-awkward-dislike-mass-transit/|title=Elon Musk Really Doesn't Like Mass Transit Systems He's Trying to Build|last=Marshall|first=Aarian|date=December 14, 2017|work=WIRED|access-date=December 23, 2017}}</ref>

[[Jarrett Walker]], a known public transport expert and consultant from [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], said that "Musk's hatred of sharing space with strangers is a luxury (or pathology) that only the rich can afford", referring to the theory that planning a city around the preferences&nbsp;of a minority yields&nbsp;an outcome that usually does not work for the majority.<ref name=wired20171216 /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/humantransit/status/941386665519595521|title=In cities, @elonmusk's hatred of sharing space with strangers is a luxury (or pathology) that only the rich can afford.
