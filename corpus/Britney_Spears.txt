'''Britney Jean Spears''' (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. She is credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s, for which she is referred to as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]". After appearing in stage productions and television series, Spears signed with [[Jive Records]] in 1997 at age 15. Her first two studio albums, certified diamond in the US, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), were global successes and became two of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all-time]], along with making her the best-selling teenage artist of all time. The former's [[...Baby One More Time (song)|title track]] was ranked at number one by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 2020 as the greatest debut single of all time<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/greatest-debut-songs-singles-990470/|date=May 19, 2020|title=The 100 Greatest Debut Singles of All Time |accessdate=July 18, 2020|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> and the latter held a 15-year record for fastest-selling album by a female artist with [[Lists of fastest-selling albums|over 1.3 million copies sold]] in its first week in the U.S. alone.

Spears adopted more mature and provocative themes and aesthetics for her next two studio albums, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' (2002). She became the executive producer of her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-blackout-a-salute-to-her-misunderstood-punk-masterpiece-121525/|title=Britney Spears' 'Blackout': A Salute to Her Misunderstood Punk Masterpiece|last=|first=|date=|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> Due to a series of heavily publicized personal struggles in the public eye, promotion for the album was limited and she was later involuntarily placed in a [[conservatorship]]. Since then, she released the chart topping albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), the latter of which became her most successful era of singles in the US charts. She embarked on a four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino]] in Las Vegas to promote her next two albums ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016). Since 2019, Spears has been involved in an ongoing court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by her conservatorship team.

Spears has scored six number one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="billboard_472190">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472190/britney-spears-snares-sixth-no-1-on-billboard-200-with-femme-fatale |title=Britney Spears Snares Sixth No. 1 on Billboard 200 with 'Femme Fatale' |work=Billboard |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}</ref> She also has four solo number one singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]", "[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]", "[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]", and "[[Hold It Against Me]]". As a featured artist, the "[[S&M (song)|S&M]]" remix also topped the ''Billboard'' chart. Other singles, "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]", "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]", and "[[Scream & Shout]]", topped the charts in most countries. With "3" in 2009 and "Hold It Against Me" in 2011, she became the second artist after [[Mariah Carey]] in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs. Spears's self-made heavily choreographed videography is considered a focal point to the success of her career, such as the image-redefining video and single "[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]". For this, she has been awarded the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award]] as praise for her provocative boundaries-pushing art in young female entertainment. She has earned [[List of awards and nominations received by Britney Spears|numerous awards]] and accolades, including a [[Grammy Award]]; seven [[Guinness Book of World Records|Guinness World Records]]; six [[MTV Video Music Awards]]; seven [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], including the Millennium Award;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7350405/britney-spears-billboard-millenium-award-honoree|title=Britney Spears to Perform Hits Medley at Billboard Music Awards|website=Billboard|accessdate=October 11, 2019}}</ref> the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; and a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-11/18/content_282531.htm Britney Spears gets star on Walk of Fame] (November 18, 2003)</ref>

At age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing "[[What Child Is This?]]" at her [[kindergarten]] graduation. During her childhood, she also had gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=56}}</ref><ref name="stone99"/><ref name=foxnews>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html|title=Britney Spears' Biography |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=June 6, 2010  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131124739/https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html| archive-date=January 31, 2011}}</ref> She said about her ambition as a child, "I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age".<ref name="stone99"/>

At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to [[Atlanta]], Georgia to audition for the 1990s revival of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.

Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and was cast in a number of commercials.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}</ref> In December 1992, she was cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' alongside [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ryan Gosling]], and [[Keri Russell]]. After the show was canceled in 1996, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's [[Parklane Academy]]. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to "the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to [[homecoming]] and [[Winter Formal|Christmas formal]]. But I wanted more."<ref name="stone99"/><ref name="rs2">{{cite journal|title=Cover Story: The Girl Can't Help It|date=May 25, 2000|work=Rolling Stone|last=Mundy|first=Chris|issn=0035-791X}}</ref>

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join the female pop group [[Innosense]]. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a [[Audio engineer|sound engineer]]. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, saying that audiences wanted pop bands such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the [[Spice Girls]], and "there wasn't going to be another [[Madonna]], another [[Debbie Gibson]], or another [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]]."<ref name="hughes145" />

Two weeks later, executives from [[Jive Records]] returned calls to Rudolph.<ref name="hughes145" /> Senior vice president of [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] Jeff Fenster said about Spears's audition that "it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal...For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'—is extremely important. And Britney had that."<ref name="stone99"/> Spears sang Houston's "[[I Have Nothing]]" (1992) for the executives, and was subsequently signed to the label.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Taylor, Chuck | url = https://books.google.com/?id=JQoEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA1&pg=PA80#v=onepage | journal=Billboard | title = Air Waves: Jive's Britney Spears Sets Top 40 Abuzz With Rhythm-Leaning 'Baby One More Time' | volume = 110 | issue = 43 | date = October 24, 1998 | accessdate = March 11, 2011 | issn = 0006-2510 }}</ref> They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney."<ref name="Hughes 2005 147">{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}</ref> After hearing the recorded material, president [[Clive Calder]] ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned "[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger; more adult contemporary." She felt secure with her label's appointment of producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me."<ref name="stone99"/> She flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]] and [[Rami Yacoub]], among others.<ref name="stone99"/>

After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back-up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for [[NSYNC]].<ref>{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=28}}</ref> Her debut studio album, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'', was released on January 12, 1999.<ref name="stone99"/> It debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified two-times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] after a month.

The [[...Baby One More Time (song)|title track]] was released as the [[lead single]] from the album.

On January 31, 2020, a Spears fan pop-up experience dubbed ''The Zone'' in [[Los Angeles]] was created, having transformed from a former Kmart. It was described as an "immersive pop-up experience and retail shop that celebrates Britney Spears's iconic songs, videos, and outfits through Instagram-worthy photo ops, interactive displays and personalized content activated by special RFID wristbands". Critics of Spears's conservatorship expressed disappointment with the pop-up and urged others to boycott it, believing it was "created for her team to profit from her name and legacy without her input," in the midst of her hiatus where they would receive less revenue.<ref>{{cite web|title=If You Seek Britney: The Zone, an Immersive Spears Fan Experience, Comes to L.A.|url=https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/britney-spears-the-zone/|last=Baj|first=Lavender|date=January 30, 2020|publisher=LA Magazine|accessdate=August 2, 2020}}</ref> On May 29, 2020, Spears released ''Glory''{{'}}s Japanese-exclusive bonus track, "[[Mood Ring (song)|Mood Ring]]", to streaming and digital platforms worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Britney Spears Rereleases Rare Song You Probably Haven't Heard: Listen!|url=https://www.etonline.com/britney-spears-rereleases-rare-song-you-probably-havent-heard-listen-147380|last=Calvario|first=Liz|date=May 29, 2020|publisher=ET Online|accessdate=May 29, 2020}}</ref>

Spears has cited [[Madonna]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[Whitney Houston]] as being major influences in her career, her "three favorite artists" as a child, whom she would "sing along to [...] day and night in [her] living room"; Houston's "[[I Have Nothing]]" was the song she auditioned to that landed her record deal with Jive Records.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Horvitz, Louis J.

After meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: "she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place.

An early criticism of Spears dismissed her as a "manufactured pop star, the product of a Swedish songwriting factory that had no real hand in either her music or her persona", which ''Vox'' editor Constance Grady assesses as being perpetuated from the fact that Spears debuted in the late 1990s, when music was dominated by [[rockism]], that prizes "so-called authenticity and grittiness of rock above all else". Spears's "slick, breezy pop was an affront to rockist sensibilities, and claiming that Spears was fake was an easy way to dismiss her." Ron Levy for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that "I have to tell you, if the record company could have created more than one Britney Spears, they would have done it, and they tried!"<ref name=voxfreebritney/>
