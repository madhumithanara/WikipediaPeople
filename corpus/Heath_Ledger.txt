Prior to his return to New York from his last film assignment, in London, in January 2008, while he was apparently suffering from some kind of [[respiratory illness]], he reportedly complained to his co-star from ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'', [[Christopher Plummer]], that he was continuing to have difficulty sleeping and taking pills to help with that problem: "Confirming earlier reports that Ledger hadn't been feeling well on set, Plummer says, 'we all caught colds because we were shooting outside on horrible, damp nights. But Heath's went on and I don't think he dealt with it immediately with the [[antibiotic]]s.... I think what he did have was the [[Atypical pneumonia|walking pneumonia]].' [...] On top of that, 'He was saying all the time, 'dammit, I can't sleep'... and he was taking all these pills to help him'".<ref name=Stoynoff />

In talking with ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine after Ledger's death, Michelle Williams confirmed reports that the actor had experienced trouble sleeping: "For as long as I'd known him, he had bouts with insomnia.

==Death==
At about 3:00&nbsp;pm ([[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]), on 22 January 2008, Ledger was found unconscious in his bed by his [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], Teresa Solomon, and his [[massage|masseuse]], Diana Wolozin, in his loft at 421 [[Broome Street]] in the [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]].<ref name=NYTBarron /><ref name=Timesobit />

According to the police, Wolozin, who had arrived early for a 3:00&nbsp;pm appointment with Ledger, called Ledger's friend
[[Mary-Kate Olsen]] for help. Olsen, who was in California, directed a New York City private security guard to go to the scene. At 3:26&nbsp;pm, "less than 15 minutes after she first saw him in bed and only a few moments after the first call to Ms. Olsen", Wolozin telephoned [[9-1-1]] "to say that Mr. Ledger was not breathing". At the urging of the 9-1-1 operator, Wolozin administered [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]], which was unsuccessful in reviving him.<ref name=NewmanBaker>{{cite news |author=Andy Newman and Al Baker|title=Autopsy on Actor Is Inconclusive As Calls for Help Are Revealed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/24/nyregion/24celeb.html |work=The New York Times |date=24 January 2008|accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref>

===Autopsy and toxicology report===
On 6 February 2008, the [[Coroner|Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York]] released its conclusions. Those conclusions were based on an initial [[autopsy]] that occurred 23 January 2008 and a subsequent complete [[toxicology|toxicological analysis]].<ref name=Chan /><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news |title=Ledger's Death Caused by Accidental Overdose |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/02/06/heath.ledger/index.html |work=CNN |date=6 February 2008|accessdate=7 February 2008}}</ref><ref name=LKLLedger>{{cite news|author=Larry King|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2008/02/06/lkl.heath.ledger.death.cnn |title=Video: Larry King Live: Ledger Death|work=[[Larry King Live]] |format=[[Video clip]]|publisher=CNN|date=6 February 2008|accessdate=5 February 2008|quote=CNN's Larry King talks to guests about the finding that actor Heath Ledger died from an accidental drug overdose.|author-link=Larry King }}</ref> The report concluded that Ledger died "as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of [[oxycodone]], [[hydrocodone]], [[diazepam]], [[temazepam]], [[alprazolam]] and [[doxylamine]]". It added: "We have concluded that the manner of death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescribed medications."<ref name=Chan /><ref name="APMSNBC" />

While the medications found in the toxicological analysis may be prescribed in the United States for [[insomnia]], [[anxiety]], [[pain]], or [[common cold]] symptoms (doxylamine), the vast majority of physicians in the U.S. are extremely reluctant to prescribe multiple [[benzodiazepine]]s (e.g., diazepam, alprazolam, and temazepam) to a single patient, let alone to prescribe such medications to a patient already taking a mix of oxycodone and hydrocodone.

In 2017, Jason Payne-James, a forensic pathologist, asserted that Ledger might have survived if hydrocodone and oxycodone had been left out of the combination of drugs that the actor took just prior to his death. He furthermore stated that the combination of drugs, combined with a possible chest infection, caused Ledger to stop breathing.<ref>"Autopsy: The Last Hours of Heath Ledger." ''Autopsy.'' Exec Prod.

===Federal investigation===
Late in February 2008, a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] investigation of medical professionals relating to Ledger's death exonerated two American physicians, who practice in Los Angeles and [[Houston]], of any wrongdoing, determining that "the doctors in question had prescribed Ledger other medications – not the pills that killed him."<ref name=WENN2>{{cite news|author=WENN (World Entertainment News Network)|title=Heath Ledger Doctors Cleared |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Heath_Ledger_Doctors_Cleared/5091865|work=Hollywood.com|date=29 February 2008|accessdate=5 March 2008<!--needs replaced archive link; can't use the archive dot is service any more-->}}</ref><ref name=Egan>{{cite news |author=Nicole Weisensee Egan|title=Report: Doctors Cleared in Ledger Investigation|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20181179,00.html|work=People |date=28 February 2008|accessdate=5 March 2008}}</ref>

Portraying a variety of roles, from [[romantic hero]]es to the [[Sympathetic character|reluctantly oppressed]], Ledger created a hodgepodge of characters that are deliberately unlike one another, stating "I feel like I am wasting my time if I repeat myself". He also reflected on his inability to be happy with his work, "I feel the same thing about everything I do. The day I say, 'It's good' is the day I should start doing something else."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/movies/moviesspecial/04lyal.html|title=Heath Ledger – I'm Not There -|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|date=4 November 2007|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=4 March 2016}}</ref> Ledger liked to wait between jobs so that he would start creatively hungry on new projects.<ref name="Nolan.

Directors who have worked with the actor praised him for his creativity, [[seriousness]] and [[intuition]]. "I've never felt as old as I did watching Heath explore his talents," ''The Dark Knight'' director Christopher Nolan has written, expressing amazement over the actor's working process, genuine curiosity and charisma.<ref name="Nolan. Christopher 2008" /> [[Marc Forster]], who directed Ledger in ''Monster's Ball'', complimented him as taking the job "very seriously", being disciplined, observant, and [[Nous|understanding and intuitive]]. In 2007, director Todd Haynes compared Ledger's presence to actor [[James Dean]], casting Ledger as Robbie Clarke, a fictive personification of Bob Dylan in ''I'm Not There''. Drawing on the similar characteristics between the actors, Haynes further highlighted Ledger's "precocious seriousness" and intuition. He also felt that Ledger had a rare maturity beyond his years."<ref name=":0" /> Ledger, however, disconnected himself and acting from [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]]. "I'm always gonna pull myself apart and dissect [the work]. I mean, there's no such thing as perfection in what [actors] do. [[pornographic film actor|Pornos]] are more perfect than we are, because they're actually fucking."<ref name="www.rollingstone.com" />

"Some people find their shtick," Ledger reflected on the categorisation of style. "I never figured out who 'Heath Ledger' is on film: 'This is what you expect when you hire me, and it will be recognisable'... People always feel compelled to sum you up, to presume that they have you and can describe you. That's fine. But there are so many stories inside of me and a lot I want to achieve outside of one flat note."<ref name=":0" />

Speaking of editing ''The Dark Knight,'' on which Ledger had completed his work in October 2007, Nolan recalled, "It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day. ...
