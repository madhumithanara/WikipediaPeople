=====2001 postseason (Super Bowl XXXVI)=====
In Brady's [[Tuck Rule Game|first playoff game]], he threw for 312 yards against the [[2001 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] and led the Patriots back from a ten-point fourth-quarter deficit to send the game to overtime, where they won on an [[Adam Vinatieri]] field goal. A controversial play occurred in the fourth quarter of that game.

Brady finished the season with 4,806 passing yards, 50 touchdown passes, and only eight interceptions. It was unanimously voted the greatest passing season of all time by ESPN in 2013. His 50:8 touchdown to interception ratio was, at the time, an NFL record. He became the first quarterback to pass for 50 touchdowns in a season and his 117.2 passer rating is{{when|date=January 2015}} the fourth highest in a single season. His 8.7% touchdown passing percentage is{{when|date=January 2015}} the third highest ever in a season. He led the Patriots to becoming the first team to ever go undefeated in the regular season since the 16 game schedule was enforced and directed an offense that scored a then NFL record 589 points and 75 total touchdowns. Those records stood until they were eclipsed by the 2013 Denver Broncos. The team's 50 total touchdown passes is the fourth most ever in a season. For his efforts, Brady was named the [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] of this season, as well as [[National Football League Offensive Player of the Year Award|Offensive Player of the Year]]. He was also honored by the [[Associated Press]] as their [[Associated Press Athlete of the Year|Male Athlete of the Year]], the first time an NFL player has been so honored since Joe Montana won the award in 1990.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/2007-12-21-ap-male-athlete-of-year_N.htm|title=Brady an easy winner in AP Male Athlete of Year balloting|date=December 21, 2007|agency=Associated Press|work=USA Today|accessdate=January 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123005147/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/2007-12-21-ap-male-athlete-of-year_N.htm|archive-date=January 23, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> He was named as a First Team All-Pro and to his fourth career Pro Bowl as a result of his historic season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2007/allpro.htm |title=2007 NFL All-Pros |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=March 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319093121/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2007/allpro.htm |archive-date=March 19, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2007/probowl.htm |title=2007 NFL Pro Bowlers |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=March 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316023313/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2007/probowl.htm |archive-date=March 16, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Statistically, Brady did not fare as well in the [[2007–08 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: New England Patriots 21, San Diego Chargers 12|AFC Championship Game]] against the [[2007 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]], throwing for 209 yards, two touchdowns, three interceptions (including his first interception in the red zone since the playoff loss to Denver in the 2005 postseason). Nevertheless, the Patriots won their 18th game of the season, 21–12, to advance to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in seven seasons. Brady, with the 100th win of his career, also set an NFL record for the fewest games needed by a starting quarterback to do so: his 100–26 record is sixteen games better than Joe Montana's.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=280120017 |title=Pats put away Chargers for fourth Super Bowl berth in seven years |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=January 20, 2008 |accessdate=November 30, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924151256/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=280120017 |archive-date=September 24, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>
In [[Super Bowl XLII]] at the [[University of Phoenix Stadium]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]], Brady was pressured heavily and sacked five times.

=====2019 postseason=====
[[File:Brady and Michel.png|thumb|alt=Brady receiving a snap, pictured from behind|Brady alongside [[Sony Michel]] in the AFC Wild Card game against the [[Tennessee Titans]].]]
Despite finishing the regular season with a 12–4 record and winning the AFC East title for the 11th consecutive year, the Patriots were forced to start their postseason run in the [[2019–20 NFL playoffs|Wild Card Round]] for the first time since 2009, where they faced the [[2019 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]]. With his team trailing by a 14–13 score and pinned back on their own 1-yard line with 15 seconds left in the game, Brady's 37th and final pass attempt of the game – and his last pass attempt as a New England Patriot – was intercepted and returned for a touchdown by former teammate and Titans cornerback [[Logan Ryan]], which effectively sealed the 20–13 win for Tennessee.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Was game-ending pick-6 Tom Brady's last pass as a member of the Patriots? |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/was-gameending-pick-6-tom-bradys-last-pass-as-a-member-of-the-patriots-044821592.html |last=Young |first=Shalise Manza  |date=January 4, 2020 |website=Yahoo!

In addition, this also marked the first time since the 2010 season in which the Patriots did not reach the AFC Championship Game, ending their NFL record run of eight consecutive AFC title game appearances. The loss to the Titans was Brady's final game as a New England Patriot; on March 17, 2020, the day before his contract with the Patriots expired, Brady announced that he would not re-sign with the team for the 2020 season, ending his 20-year tenure in New England.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gaydos |first1=Ryan |title=Tom Brady to join Tampa Bay Buccaneers, agrees to deal in principle: report |url=https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tom-brady-buccaneers-agrees-deal-in-principle-report |website=Fox News |accessdate=March 18, 2020 |date=March 17, 2020}}</ref>

After Brady signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, billboards thanking Brady for his 20 years were posted alongside the [[Interstate 90|Massachusetts Turnpike]], a mile from Gillette Stadium and ten other locations around New England.<ref>{{cite web |title='The Greatest Of All Time!': Kraft Family Thanks Tom Brady With Billboards |url=https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/03/19/tom-brady-new-england-patriots-thank-you-billboard/ |website=CBS Boston |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |date=March 19, 2020}}</ref>

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Brady signed with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] on March 20, 2020. The two-year contract was worth $50 million in fully guaranteed money, with up to $4.5 million each year in incentives. The deal also included a no-trade and a no-tag clause.<ref>{{cite news|last=Patra|first=Kevin|title=Tom Brady officially signs contract with Buccaneers|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001107130/article/tom-brady-officially-signs-contract-with-buccaneers|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=March 20, 2020|access-date=March 21, 2020}}</ref> Although his career number of 12 was already taken, [[Chris Godwin]] agreed to give it to Brady and switched to number 14.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/tb12-tom-brady-chris-godwin-jersey-numbers-2020 |title=TB12, Still: Tom Brady Accepts Chris Godwin's Offer |last=Smith |first=Scott |date=April 1, 2020 |website=Buccaneers.com |access-date=March 31, 2020}}</ref>
