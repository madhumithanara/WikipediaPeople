In 1992, he appeared in a cameo role in the film ''[[Honeymoon in Vegas]]'' and was interviewed by [[Pauly Shore]] on MTV. When Mars was six years-old, he was featured on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' and throughout grade school, he performed with his family's band, two shows a night, covering [[Frankie Lymon]] and [[Little Anthony]], as well. When he was a child he had a small version of a drum set, guitar, piano and some percussion and learned to play the instruments. By age 12, his parents divorced, thus ending The Love Notes act. His father's various businesses, that ranged from temporary-tattoo parlor to memorabilia shops, failed. Consequently, there was no longer a steady source of income. He moved out of his parents' house along with his brother and father. They lived in the "slums of Hawaii", on the back of a car, on rooftops, and in an abandoned bird zoo, Paradise Park, where Mars' father worked before it closed.<ref name="RSBH"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bruno-mars-used-to-call-home-60-minutes/|title=The park Bruno Mars used to call home|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=November 17, 2016|accessdate=February 3, 2019}}</ref> The singer had to move to a new schools and initially he was bullied, but he became popular in his last school days.<ref name="RSBH"/>

After Mars' sister in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] played his [[Demo (music)|demo]] for Mike Lynn, (the head of [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] at [[Dr. Dre]]'s [[Aftermath Entertainment]] record label), Lynn summoned Mars to Los Angeles.<ref name="Forbes: Mars Attacks!" /> In 2003, shortly after graduating from high school at the age of 17, Mars moved to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career.<ref name="midweek" /><ref name="usatoday">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2010-09-16-brunomars16_ST_N.htm|title=Bruno Mars gravitates toward a stellar solo career|last=Artsitas|first=George|work=[[USA Today]]|date=September 15, 2010|accessdate=September 15, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918185138/http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2010-09-16-brunomars16_ST_N.htm|archivedate=September 18, 2010}}</ref> At that time, he lived on Mansfield Avenue and was surprised by the poverty and squalor of the neighborhood.<ref name="RSBH"/> He adopted his stage name from the childhood nickname his father gave him, adding "Mars" at the end because: "I felt like I didn't have [any] pizzazz, and a lot of girls say I’m out of this world, so I was like I guess I'm from [[Mars]]."<ref name="10 Questions">{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/05/11/10-questions-for-bruno-mars/|title=10 Questions for Bruno Mars|last=Cline|first=Georgette|work=[[Rap-Up]]|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> Moreover, the adoption of his stage name was also an effort to "avoid being stereotyped", as the [[music industry]] tried to pigeonhole him as another [[Latin music|Latin]] artist.

Shortly after moving to Los Angeles, Mars signed a record contract with [[Motown|Motown Records]] in 2004, but the deal "went nowhere", leading him to have a conversation with [[will.i.am]]'s management, which also turned out to be fruitless.<ref name="Orbit">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2011-01-25-brunomars25_ST_N.htm|title=Bruno Mars' musical orbit seems inescapable|last=Jones|first=Steve|work=USA Today|date=January 25, 2011|accessdate=February 3, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201064858/http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2011-01-25-brunomars25_ST_N.htm|archivedate=February 1, 2011}}</ref><ref name="GQ interview">{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/style/wear-it-now/201304/bruno-mars-interview-gq-april-2013|pp=2–3|title=The Mars Expedition|last=Heath|first=Christ|work=[[GQ]]|issue=April 2013|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref> However, the singer's experience with Motown proved to be beneficial to his career.

When Philip Lawrence was first told he should meet Mars he was reluctant to do so since he did not even have money for bus fare.

guys and I love studying them because I’m a fan.<ref name="Meetsbruno"/></blockquote> He also impersonated Michael Jackson who is a major inspiration of his.<ref name="midweek"/> Mars was raised on his father's [[doo-wop]] collection – "simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point" and on Ventures, [[Chuck Berry]], [[Carlos Santana]], Frankie Lymon, [[Little Anthony]], [[Little Richard]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].

Ideas occur suddenly to him; and occasionally, he is able to materialize them into lyrics.<ref name="TSMC"/>

Mars claims that his work with other artists has influenced his musical style: "''Nothin' on You'' had a Motown vibe, ''Billionaire'' was a reggae acoustic guitar-driven song, though one of my favourites is the [[CeeLo Green]] song. I don't think anyone else could've sung that song. And there's ''Just the Way You Are''.

He explains: "In Hawaii some of the biggest radio stations are reggae. That music brings people together. It's not urban music or pop music. It's just songs. That's what makes it cross over so well. The song comes first."<ref name="DailyNews"/>

[[Philip Lawrence (songwriter)|Philip Lawrence]], one of his music partners from [[The Smeezingtons]], stated: "What people don't know is there's a darker underbelly to Bruno Mars."

Due to the [[Ticket resale|ticket reselling]] which occurred during the week after Mars' performance at the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, [[Hawaii Senate]] President [[Donna Mercado Kim]] introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the ''Bruno Mars Act''. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should almost certainly be guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jesselawrence/2014/02/12/could-the-bruno-mars-act-change-the-way-tickets-are-bought-for-high-demand-concerts/|title=Could "The Bruno Mars Act" Change The Way Tickets Are Bought For High Demand Concerts?|last=Lawrence|first=Jesse|work=Forbes|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=February 27, 2014}}</ref> The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jesselawrence/2014/04/03/sparse-primary-market-helps-drive-up-price-of-bruno-mars-tickets-on-secondary-market/|title=Sparse Primary Market Helps Drive Up Price of Bruno Mars Tickets on Secondary Market|last=Lawrence|first=Jesse|work=Forbes|date=April 4, 2014|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref> However, the bill died at the conference committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/38409717/how-did-so-many-get-shut-out-of-bruno-mars-tickets-blame-it-on-the-bots/|title=How did so many get shut out of Bruno Mars tickets?

His mother died the next day.<ref name="RSJE">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/life-on-planet-mars-w447916|title=Bruno Mars: The Private Anxiety of a Pop Perfectionist|last=Eells|first=Josh|work=Rolling Stone|date=November 2, 2016|accessdate=November 2, 2016}}</ref> On June 2, 2013, a publicist for Atlantic Records confirmed to the Associated Press that Mars' mother had suffered a [[brain aneurysm]].

===Race===
In 2013, Mars told ''Rolling Stone'' that record executives "had trouble categorizing him", as they were clueless which radio stations would play his songs, and which people (black or white) were going to buy his albums.<ref name="RSBH"/> In the same month, he confessed that "Nothin' on You" was rejected by a "music industry decision-maker" because of his race. That experience made him feel like a "mutant", and he says that was his lowest point. "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that are coming out of people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2013/05/17/bruno-mars-red-hot/2/|title=Bruno Mars is red hot|last=Greenblatt|first=Leah|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=May 17, 2013|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref> In 2018, Mars was accused during The Grapevine, a series that explores African-American issues, of cultural appropriation on social media for using his racial ambiguity to profit from black music, and was criticized for mimicking the sound of past artists.

===Legal issues===
On January 28, 2014, Demetrius Orlandus Proctor filed a lawsuit, claiming he holds the copyright for the Travie McCoy and Mars' track "Billionaire".

As evidence, Proctor has submitted a United States Copyright Office registration certificate for "Frisky Vol. 1 to 30 (Tapes)", issued in 2000. Proctor accused McCoy and Mars of "willful and intentional" infringement of copyright, seeking the destruction of all copies of the recording. Proctor claims he has exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2014/01/bruno-mars-billionaire-lawsuit-copyright-travie-mccoy/|title=Wanna Be a 'Billionaire': Bruno Mars and Travie McCoy Sued Over Copyright|last=Martins|first=Chris|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=January 29, 2014|accessdate=March 28, 2015}}</ref>
