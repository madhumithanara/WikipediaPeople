Their first show was at the Capri Theater on January 5, 1979.

In 1980, Prince released the album ''[[Dirty Mind]]'', which contained sexually explicit material, including the title song, "Head", and the song "Sister", and was described by [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] as a "stunning, audacious amalgam of funk, [[New wave music|new wave]], R&B, and pop, fueled by grinningly salacious sex and the desire to shock."<ref name="Erlewine">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

According to his former manager [[Bob Cavallo]], in the early 1980s Prince required his management to obtain a deal for him to star in a major [[motion picture]], despite the fact that his exposure at that point was limited to several pop and R&B hits, music videos and occasional TV performances. This resulted in the hit film ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'' (1984), which starred Prince and was loosely autobiographical, and the [[Purple Rain (album)|eponymous studio album]], which was also the soundtrack to the film.<ref name=raftery /> The ''Purple Rain'' album sold more than 13&nbsp;million copies in the US and spent 24 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.

In 1984, pop artist [[Andy Warhol]] created the painting ''[[Prince (painting)|Orange Prince (1984)]]''. Andy Warhol was fascinated by Prince, and ultimately created a total of twelve unique paintings of him in different colorways, all of which were kept in Warhol's personal collection.<ref>{{Cite web| url= https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/44T6MBA/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0032.3.pdf| title= Expert analysis by critic Thomas Crow of Andy Warhol's portraits of Prince|last=|first=|date=|website= pacermonitor.com|access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref> Four of these paintings are now in the collection of [[The Andy Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh.

The ''Vanity Fair'' article was one of the first global media pieces written as a critical appreciation of the musician, which coincided with the start of the 98-date [[Purple Rain Tour]].

After [[Tipper Gore]] heard her 11-year-old daughter [[Karenna Gore|Karenna]] listening to Prince's song "[[Darling Nikki]]" (which gained wide notoriety for its sexual lyrics and a reference to masturbation), she founded the [[Parents Music Resource Center]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Siegel |first=Robert |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4279560 |title=Tipper Gore and Family Values : NPR Music |publisher=NPR |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref> The center advocated the mandatory use of a warning label ("[[Parental Advisory]]: Explicit Lyrics") on the covers of records that have been judged to contain language or lyrical content [[unsuitable for minors]].

In 1985, Prince announced that he would discontinue live performances and music videos after the release of his next album. His subsequent recording, ''[[Around the World in a Day]]'' (1985), held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' 200 for three weeks.

In 1986, Prince began a series of live performances called the [[Hit n Run – Parade Tour]]. After the tour Prince disbanded the Revolution and fired [[Wendy & Lisa]].<ref name=raftery /> Brown Mark quit the band; keyboardist Doctor Fink remained.

===1987–1991: ''Sign o' the Times'', ''Lovesexy'', ''Batman'', and ''Graffiti Bridge''===
Prior to the disbanding of the Revolution, Prince was working on two separate projects, the Revolution album ''[[Dream Factory (album)|Dream Factory]]'' and a solo effort, ''[[Camille (unreleased Prince album)|Camille]]''.{{sfn|Draper|2008|pp=76–78}} Unlike the three previous band albums, ''Dream Factory'' included input from the band members and featured songs with lead vocals by Wendy & Lisa.{{sfn|Draper|2008|pp=76–78}} The ''Camille'' project saw Prince create a new [[androgynous]] persona primarily singing in a sped-up, female-sounding voice. With the dismissal of the Revolution, Prince consolidated material from both shelved albums, along with some new songs, into a three-LP album to be titled ''[[Crystal Ball (unreleased album)|Crystal Ball]]''.{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=80}} Warner Bros. forced Prince to trim the triple album to a double album, and ''[[Sign o' the Times]]'' was released on March 31, 1987.<ref name="Billboard Sign o the times">{{cite web|first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=prince|chart=all}} |title=Sign 'O' the Times |work=Billboard |accessdate=March 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509100710/http://www.billboard.com/artist/351039/prince/chart |archivedate=May 9, 2013}}</ref>

It was named the top album of the year by the [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll and sold 3.2&nbsp;million copies.{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=81}} In Europe, it performed well, and Prince promoted the album overseas with a lengthy tour. Putting together a new backing band from the remnants of the Revolution, Prince added bassist [[Levi Seacer Jr.]], keyboardist Boni Boyer, and dancer/choreographer [[Cat Glover]]{{sfn|Gregory|1995|p=246}} to go with new drummer [[Sheila E]]{{sfn|Matos|2004|p=57}} and holdovers Miko Weaver, Doctor Fink, Eric Leeds, Atlanta Bliss, and the Bodyguards (Jerome, Wally Safford, and Greg Brooks) for the [[Sign o' the Times Tour]].

The Sign o' the Times tour was a success overseas, and Warner Bros. and Prince's managers wanted to bring it to the US to promote sales of the album;{{sfn|Draper|2008|pp=86–87}}{{sfn|Hahn|2004|p = 118}} Prince balked at a full US tour, as he was ready to produce a new album.{{sfn|Draper|2008|pp=86–87}} As a compromise, the last two nights of the tour were filmed for release in movie theaters. The film quality was deemed subpar, and reshoots were performed at Prince's [[Paisley Park]] studios.{{sfn|Draper|2008|pp=86–87}} The film ''[[Sign o' the Times (film)|Sign o' the Times]]'' was released on November 20, 1987. The film got better reviews than ''Under the Cherry Moon'', but its box-office receipts were minimal, and it quickly left theaters.{{sfn|Hahn|2004|p = 118}}

The next album intended for release was ''[[The Black Album (Prince album)|The Black Album]]''.{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=90}} More instrumental and funk- and R&B-themed than recent releases,{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=92}} ''The Black Album'' also saw Prince experiment with [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] on the songs "Bob George" and "Dead on It". Prince was set to release the album with a monochromatic black cover with only the catalog number printed, but after 500,000 copies had been pressed,{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=91}} Prince had a spiritual epiphany that the album was evil and had it recalled.{{sfn|Hahn|2004|pp = 121–122}} It was later released by Warner Bros. as a limited edition album in 1994.

Prince went back in the studio for eight weeks and recorded ''[[Lovesexy]]''. Released on May 10, 1988, ''Lovesexy'' serves as a spiritual opposite to the dark ''The Black Album''.{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=93}} Every song is a solo effort by Prince, except "Eye No", which was recorded with his backing band at the time. ''Lovesexy'' reached No. 11 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and No. 5 on the R&B albums chart.<ref name="Lovesexy billboard">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=prince|chart=all}} |title=Lovesexy |work=Billboard |accessdate=January 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509100710/http://www.billboard.com/artist/351039/prince/chart |archivedate=May 9, 2013}}</ref> The lead single, "[[Alphabet St.]]", peaked at No. 8 on the Hot 100 and No. 3 on the R&B chart;<ref name="Billboard Sign o the times" /> it sold 750,000 copies.{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=94}}

Prince again took his post-Revolution backing band (minus the Bodyguards) on a three-leg, 84-show [[Lovesexy World Tour]]; although the shows were well-received by huge crowds, they failed to make a net profit due to the expensive sets and props.{{sfn|Hahn|2004|pp = 152–153}}{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=95}}

[[File:Prince by jimieye.jpg|thumb|Prince performing during the [[Nude Tour]] in [[Tokyo|Tokyo, Japan]] in 1990|alt=|238x238px]]
In 1989, Prince appeared on [[Madonna]]'s studio album ''[[Like a Prayer (album)|Like a Prayer]]'', co-writing and singing the duet "Love Song" and playing electric guitar (uncredited) on the songs "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]", "[[Keep It Together (song)|Keep It Together]]", and "Act of Contrition".

The single "[[The Arms of Orion]]", with Sheena Easton, charted at No. 36, and "[[Partyman]]" (also featuring the vocals of Prince's then-girlfriend, nicknamed [[Anna Fantastic]]) charted at No. 18 on the Hot 100 and at No. 5 on the R&B chart, while the love ballad "[[Scandalous!]]" went to No. 5 on the R&B chart.<ref name="Billboard Sign o the times" /> Prince had to sign away all publishing rights to the songs on the album to Warner Bros. as part of the deal to do the soundtrack.

In 1990, Prince went back on tour with a revamped band for his back-to-basics [[Nude Tour]]. With the departures of Boni Boyer, Sheila E., the horns, and Cat, Prince brought in keyboardist [[Rosie Gaines]], drummer [[Michael Bland]], and dancing trio the Game Boyz ([[Tony M.]], Kirky J., and Damon Dickson). The European and Japanese tour was a financial success with a short, greatest hits setlist.{{sfn|Hahn|2004|p = 166}} As the year progressed, Prince finished production on his fourth film, ''[[Graffiti Bridge (film)|Graffiti Bridge]]'' (1990), and the [[Graffiti Bridge (album)|1990 album of the same name]]. Initially, Warner Bros. was reluctant to fund the film, but with Prince's assurances it would be a sequel to ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'' as well as the involvement of the original members of the Time, the studio greenlit the project.{{sfn|Draper|2008|p=104}} Released on August 20, 1990, the album reached No. 6 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and R&B albums chart.<ref name="Graffiti Bridge billboard">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=prince|chart=all}} |title=Graffiti Bridge |work=Billboard |accessdate=January 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509100710/http://www.billboard.com/artist/351039/prince/chart |archivedate=May 9, 2013}}</ref> The single "[[Thieves in the Temple]]" reached No. 6 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the R&B chart;<ref name="Billboard Sign o the times" /> "[[Round and Round (Tevin Campbell song)|Round and Round]]" placed at No. 12 on the US charts and No. 2 on the R&B charts.

After failed attempts in 1990 and 1991,{{sfn|Hahn|2004|pp = 192–193}} Warner Bros. released a [[Greatest hits album|greatest hits]] compilation with the three-disc ''[[The Hits/The B-Sides]]'' in 1993. The first two discs were also sold separately as ''The Hits 1'' and ''The Hits 2''. The collection features the majority of Prince's hit singles (with the exception of "[[Batdance]]" and other songs that appeared on the ''[[Batman (album)|Batman]]'' soundtrack), and several previously hard-to-find recordings, including [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] from across Prince's career and previously unreleased tracks such as the Revolution-recorded "Power Fantastic" and a live recording of "[[Nothing Compares 2 U]]" with Rosie Gaines. Two new songs, "[[Pink Cashmere]]" and "[[Peach (Prince song)|Peach]]", were chosen as promotional singles.

In 1993, in rebellion against Warner Bros., which refused to release Prince's enormous backlog of music at a steady pace,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36107590|title=Why did Prince change his name to a symbol?|work=BBC News|accessdate=May 5, 2016|date=April 22, 2016|first=Jessica|last=Lussenhop}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legalcheek.com/2016/04/prince-hated-contract-law-so-much-he-once-changed-his-name-to-an-unpronounceable-symbol/|title=Prince hated contract law so much he once changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol|work=Legal Cheek}}</ref> Prince formally adopted the "Love Symbol" as his stage name.<ref name="nytimes_07-11-02" /> To use the symbol in print media, Warner Bros. organized a mass mailing of [[floppy disk]]s with a custom font.<ref>{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Feldman |url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/04/princes-legendary-floppy-disk-symbol-font.html|accessdate=May 5, 2016 |title=The Legend of Prince's Special Custom-Font Symbol Floppy Disks |newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=April 21, 2016 }}</ref> At this time, Prince was referred to as the Artist Formerly Known as Prince or the Artist.<ref name="bass player"/>

In 1994, Prince began to release albums in quick succession as a means of releasing himself from his contractual obligations to Warner Bros. He also began appearing with the word "slave" written on his face.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/12-wildest-prince-moments-20160422/prince-writes-slave-on-face-changes-name-to-unpronounceable-symbol-1993-20160422|title=12 Wildest Prince Moments|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> He believed Warner Bros. was intent on limiting his artistic freedom by insisting he release albums more sporadically. He also blamed Warner Bros. for the poor commercial performance of ''Love Symbol'', claiming they had marketed it insufficiently. It was out of these developments that the aborted ''[[The Black Album (Prince album)|The Black Album]]'' was officially released, seven years after its initial recording. The "new" release was already in wide circulation as a [[bootleg recording|bootleg]]. Warner Bros. then succumbed to Prince's wishes to release an album of new material, ''[[Come (Prince album)|Come]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Prince pushed to have his next album ''[[The Gold Experience]]'' released simultaneously with ''Love Symbol''-era material. Warner Bros. allowed the single "[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Prince song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]" to be released via a small, independent distributor, [[Bellmark Records]], in February 1994. The release reached No. 3 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 1 in many other countries, but it did not prove to be a model for subsequent releases. Warner Bros. still resisted releasing ''The Gold Experience'', fearing poor sales and citing "[[market saturation]]" as a defense. When released in September 1995, ''The Gold Experience'' reached the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' 200 initially. The album is not currently in print due to an ongoing plagiarism case relating to '''The Most Beautiful Girl in the World'' outlined below, with digital distributors excluding the song in question from the album.

An Italian court ruled in 2003 that ''The Most Beautiful Girl in the World'', plagiarised the song "Takin’ Me to Paradise" by Bruno Bergonzi and Michele Vicino. Bergonzi and Vicino won on appeal in 2007. The third and final sentence, by the [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] of Rome was dated May 2015, although the international case is ongoing. Italian collecting society SIAE recognizes Bergonzi and Vicino as the authors of the music for ''The Most Most Beautiful Girl in the World''.<ref>Mark Worden, ''Prince's Italian Plagiarism Case Drags On'', [https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7445762/princes-italian-plagiarism-case], Retrieved 16/01/2029.

''[[Chaos and Disorder]]'', released in 1996, was Prince's final album of new material for Warner Bros., as well as one of his least commercially successful releases.

===1996–2000: ''Emancipation'', ''Crystal Ball'', and ''Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic''===
Free of any further contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Prince attempted a major comeback later that year with the release of ''[[Emancipation (Prince album)|Emancipation]]'', a 36-song, 3-CD set (each disc was exactly 60 minutes long). The album was released via his own [[NPG Records]] with distribution through [[EMI]]. To publish his songs on ''Emancipation'', Prince did not use ''Controversy Music''&nbsp;– ''ASCAP'', which he had used for all his records since 1981, but rather used ''Emancipated Music Inc.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=PRINCE&search_in=a&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=30&start=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231224724/http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=PRINCE&search_in=a&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=30&start=1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 31, 2003 |title=ASCAP profile for Emancipated Music |publisher=Ascap.com |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref>&nbsp;– ''ASCAP''.

Prince released ''[[Crystal Ball (album set)|Crystal Ball]]'', a five-CD collection of unreleased material, in 1998. The distribution of this album was disorderly, with some fans pre-ordering the album on his website up to a year before it was shipped; these pre-orders were delivered months after the record had gone on sale in retail stores. The retail edition has only four discs, as it is missing the ''Kamasutra'' disc. There are also two different packaging editions for retail; one is a four-disc sized jewel case with a white cover and the Love Symbol in a colored circle while the other contains all four discs in a round translucent snap jewel case. The discs are the same, as is the CD jacket. The ''[[Newpower Soul]]'' album was released three months later. His collaborations on [[Chaka Khan]]'s ''[[Come 2 My House]]'' and [[Larry Graham]]'s ''[[GCS2000]]'', both released on the [[NPG Records]] label around the same time as ''Newpower Soul'', were promoted by live appearances on ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe with Sinbad]]'' and the [[NBC]] ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show's Summer Concert Series.

In 1999, Prince once again signed with a major label, [[Arista Records]], to release a new record, ''[[Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic]]''. A few months earlier, Warner Bros. had also released ''[[The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale]]'', a collection of unreleased material recorded by Prince throughout his career.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prince Sign of the Times|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2016/05/prince-sign-of-the-times/|date=May 8, 2016|publisher=[[Socialbilitty]]|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>

The pay-per-view concert, ''[[Rave Un2 the Year 2000]]'', was broadcast on December 31, 1999, and consisted of footage from the December 17 and 18 concerts of his 1999 tour. The concert featured appearances by guest musicians including [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], Jimmy Russell, and The Time. It was released to home video the following year.

On May 16, 2000, Prince stopped using the Love Symbol moniker as his name, after his publishing contract with [[Warner/Chappell Music|Warner/Chappell]] expired. In a press conference, he stated that after being freed from undesirable relationships associated with the name "Prince", he would revert to using his real name. Prince continued to use the symbol as a logo and on album artwork and to play a Love Symbol-shaped guitar. For several years following the release of ''Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic'', Prince primarily released new music through his Internet subscription service, NPGOnlineLtd.com which later became the NPGMusicClub.com.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bugbee|first1=Teo|title=Taylor Swift Follows Prince: The Artist Who Tamed the Corporate Giant|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/25/taylor-swift-is-the-new-prince-the-artist-that-tamed-the-corporate-giant.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=May 8, 2016|date=June 25, 2015}}</ref> Albums from this period are ''[[Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic]]'' (2001), ''[[The Rainbow Children]]'' (2001), ''[[One Nite Alone...]]'' (2002), ''[[Xpectation]]'' (2003), ''[[C-Note (album)|C-Note]]'' (2004), ''[[The Chocolate Invasion]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Slaughterhouse]]'' (2004).

In 2001, Warner Bros. released a second compilation album ''[[The Very Best of Prince]]'' containing most of his commercially successful singles from the eighties. In 2002, Prince released his first live album, ''[[One Nite Alone... Live!]]'', which features performances from the [[One Nite Alone...Tour]]. The 3-CD box set also includes a disc of "aftershow" music entitled ''It Ain't Over!''. During this time, Prince sought to engage more effectively with his fan base via the [[NPG Music Club]], pre-concert sound checks, and at yearly "celebrations" at Paisley Park, his music studios. Fans were invited into the studio for tours, interviews, discussions and music-listening sessions. Some of these fan discussions were filmed for an [[Unreleased Prince projects#Untitled Kevin Smith-directed documentary|unreleased documentary]], directed by [[Kevin Smith]].

In April 2004, Prince released ''[[Musicology (album)|Musicology]]'' through a one-album agreement with [[Columbia Records]]. The album rose as high as the top five on some international charts (including the US, UK, Germany, and Australia). The US chart success was assisted by the CDs being included as part of the concert ticket purchase, thereby qualifying each CD (as chart rules then stood) to count toward US chart placement.<ref>{{cite web| last = D'Angelo| first = Joe | title = Billboard Sours on Prince's Musicology Sales Experiment: Magazine changes policy on tallying albums sold with tickets|publisher=MTV News| date = May 28, 2004| url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1488027/20040528/prince.jhtml|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}</ref> Three months later, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' named him the greatest [[frontman]] of all time.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/prince-tops-frontmen-poll|title=Prince Tops Frontmen Poll|date=July 27, 2004|magazine=[[Contactmusic.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629095753/http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/prince-tops-frontmen-poll|archivedate=June 29, 2013|url-status=live|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref>

In April 2005, Prince played guitar (along with [[En Vogue]] singing backing vocals) on [[Stevie Wonder]]'s single "[[So What the Fuss]]", Wonder's first since 1999. In late 2005, Prince signed with [[Universal Music]] to release his album, ''[[3121 (album)|3121]]'', on March 21, 2006. The first single was "[[Te Amo Corazón]]", the video for which was directed by actress [[Salma Hayek]] and filmed in [[Marrakech]], Morocco, featuring Argentine actress and singer [[Mía Maestro]]. The video for the second single, "[[Black Sweat]]", was nominated at the [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV VMAs]] for Best Cinematography. The immediate success of ''3121'' gave Prince his first No. 1 debut on the ''Billboard'' 200 with the album.

To promote the new album, Prince was the musical guest on ''Saturday Night Live'' on February 4, 2006, 17 years after his last ''SNL'' appearance on the 15th anniversary special, and nearly 25 years since his first appearance on a regular episode in 1981.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Desire|title='Saturday Night Live' Announce 'Good Night Sweet Prince' Tribute|url=http://www.vibe.com/2016/04/prince-saturday-night-live-tribute/|accessdate=May 8, 2016|work=Vibe|date=April 23, 2016}}</ref> At the [[2006 Webby Awards]] on June 12, Prince received a [[Webby Awards|Webby]] Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his "visionary use of the Internet to distribute music and connect with audiences", exemplified by his decision to release his album ''Crystal Ball'' (1998) exclusively online.<ref name="cnetsandoval">{{cite web|last1=Sandoval|first1=Greg|title=Prince: The artist who formerly liked the Internet|url=https://cnet.com/news/prince-the-artist-who-formerly-liked-the-internet/|website=[[CNET]]|accessdate=April 23, 2016|date=November 13, 2007}}</ref><ref name="postohlheiser">{{cite news|last1=Ohlheiser|first1=Abby|title=Prince had a complicated relationship with the Internet|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/04/21/prince-had-a-long-complicated-relationship-with-the-internet/|accessdate=April 23, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 21, 2016}}</ref>

In return, Warner gave Prince ownership of the master recordings of his recordings with the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superdeluxeedition.com/news/purple-rain-deluxe-due-as-prince-and-warners-sign-new-agreement/ |title=Purple Rain Deluxe Edition |publisher=Super Deluxe Edition|date=April 18, 2014 |accessdate=August 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/04/18/304572413/prince-fans-prepare-for-the-deluge | publisher=NPR |title=Prince Fans Prepare for the Deluge|date=April 19, 2014 |accessdate=April 24, 2014}}</ref>

In February 2014 Prince began what was billed as his 'Hit N Run Part One' tour. This involved Prince's Twitter followers keeping an avid eye on second-by-second information as to the whereabouts of his shows. Many of these shows would only be announced on the day of the concert, and many of these concerts involved two performances: a [[wikt:matinée|matinee]] and an evening show. These shows began at [[Camden Town|Camden]]'s [[Electric Ballroom]], billed as 'Soundchecks', and spread throughout the UK capital to KoKo Club, in Camden, Shepherd's Bush Empire and various other small venues. After his London dates, he moved on to other European cities.

In May 2014 Prince began his 'Hit N Run Part Two' shows, which followed a more normal style of purchasing tickets online and being held in music arenas. In Spring 2014, he launched '''NPG Publishing,''' a music company to administer his own music and that of other artists without the restrictions of mainstream record companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/948911d73f9941fd938df975a3dc5f6f/day-prince-paisley-park|title=A day with Prince at Paisley Park|website=Bigstory.ap.org|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref>

In February 2016, Prince embarked on the [[Piano & A Microphone Tour]], a tour that saw his show stripped back to only him and a custom piano on stage.

At the 2008 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] ("Coachella Festival"), Prince performed a cover of [[Radiohead]]'s "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]", but immediately afterward he forced YouTube and other sites to remove footage that fans had taken of the performance, despite Radiohead's request to leave it on the website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/10102/prince_is_being_a_creep_radiohead_tell_him_hes_a_l/news/ |title= Prince Is Being A "Creep," Radiohead Tell Him He's A Loser |publisher=StereoGum |date=May 30, 2008 |accessdate=December 6, 2014}}</ref> Days later, YouTube reinstated the videos, as Radiohead said: "It's our song, let people hear it."

Prince was one of a small handful of musicians to deny [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] permission to parody his music.
