Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, [[Jon Voight]], in ''[[Lookin' to Get Out]]'' (1982), and her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production ''[[Cyborg 2]]'' (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'' (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films ''[[George Wallace (film)|George Wallace]]'' (1997) and ''[[Gia]]'' (1998), and won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance in the drama ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' (1999). Her starring role as the video game heroine [[Lara Croft]] in ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'' (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her action-star career with ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]'' (2005), ''[[Wanted (2008 film)|Wanted]]'' (2008), and ''[[Salt (2010 film)|Salt]]'' (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas ''[[A Mighty Heart (film)|A Mighty Heart]]'' (2007) and ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]'' (2008), which earned her a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] and made an honorary [[Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a [[Special Envoy]] for the [[UNHCR|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR).

== Career ==
=== 1991–1997: Early work ===
Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was "too dark."<ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic" /> She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the [[USC School of Cinema-Television]], as well as in several music videos, namely [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s "Stand by My Woman" (1991), [[Antonello Venditti]]'s "Alta Marea" (1991), [[The Lemonheads]]'s "It's About Time" (1993), and [[Meat Loaf]]'s "[[Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through]]" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both "drama queens."<ref name="Angelina Jolie Biography" />

Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel ''[[Cyborg 2]]'', as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.<ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic" /> Following a supporting role in the independent film ''[[Without Evidence]]'' (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'' (1995). ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Janet Maslin]] wrote, "Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top."<ref>{{cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE2D61631F936A2575AC0A963958260 |title=Those Wacky Teenagers and Their Crazy Fads |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 15, 1995 |accessdate=December 29, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109024040/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE2D61631F936A2575AC0A963958260 | archive-date=January 9, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> ''Hackers'' failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Brandt |first=Andrew |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/04/05/hacking.hollywood.idg/index.html?related |title=How Hollywood portrays hackers |magazine=PC World |date=May 4, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510124043/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/04/05/hacking.hollywood.idg/index.html?related |archivedate=May 10, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

After starring in the modern-day ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' adaptation ''[[Love Is All There Is]]'' (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie ''[[Mojave Moon]]'' (1996), of which ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, "Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that [[Danny Aiello]]'s character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0184646/ |title=Film review: 'Mojave Moon' |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 24, 1996 |accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> In ''[[Foxfire (1996 film)|Foxfire]]'' (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote of her performance, "It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst."<ref>{{cite news |last=Mathews |first=Jack |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-23/entertainment/ca-36764_1_drifter |title=Rebellion in 'Foxfire' Loses Impact in Leap to the '90s |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=August 23, 1996 |accessdate=December 29, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109004712/http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-23/entertainment/ca-36764_1_drifter | archive-date=January 9, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1997, Jolie starred with [[David Duchovny]] in the thriller ''[[Playing God (1997 film)|Playing God]]'', set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted that Jolie "finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is."<ref>{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971017/REVIEWS/710170306/1023 |title=Reviews: Playing God |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=October 17, 1997 |accessdate=December 29, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127164500/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19971017%2FREVIEWS%2F710170306%2F1023 | archive-date=January 27, 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref> Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the [[CBS]] miniseries ''[[True Women]]'' (1997), was even less successful; writing for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Robert Strauss dismissed her as "horrid, a fourth-rate [[Scarlett O'Hara]]" who relies on "gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips."<ref>{{cite news |last=Strauss |first=Robert |url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-05-16/entertainment/25564646_1_janice-woods-windle-true-women-annabeth-gish |newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer |title='True Women' Cooks Up a Tale of Suffering With No Nutritional Value |date=May 16, 1997 |accessdate=January 28, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085943/http://articles.philly.com/1997-05-16/entertainment/25564646_1_janice-woods-windle-true-women-annabeth-gish | archive-date=March 4, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> Jolie also starred in the music video for the [[Rolling Stones]]'s "[[Anybody Seen My Baby?]]" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.<ref>Childers, Chad (July 11, 2013).

=== 1998–2000: Breakthrough ===
Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe Award]] for her performance in [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]]'s ''[[George Wallace (film)|George Wallace]]'' (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate [[George Wallace]], played by [[Gary Sinise]]. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, [[Cornelia Wallace|Cornelia]], a performance Lee Winfrey of ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' considered a highlight of the film.<ref>{{cite news |last=Winfrey |first=Lee |url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-08-24/entertainment/25569021_1_george-wallace-arthur-bremer-alabama-gov |title=A Story Of Civil Wrongs And Eventual Repentance |newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=August 24, 1997 |accessdate=January 13, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065316/http://articles.philly.com/1997-08-24/entertainment/25569021_1_george-wallace-arthur-bremer-alabama-gov | archive-date=March 4, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> ''George Wallace'' was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film]]. Jolie also received a nomination for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie|Emmy Award]] for her performance.

Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel [[Gia Carangi]] in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Gia]]'' (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to [[heroin]], and her decline and death from [[AIDS]] in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, "Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed."<ref>{{cite web |last=Vance |first=Vanessa |url=http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=42045&PID=10086013&Tab=reviews&CID=18 |title=Gia (1998) |publisher=Reel.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611143609/http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=42045&PID=10086013&Tab=reviews&CID=18 |archivedate=June 11, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie|Emmy Award]]. She also won her first [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie|Screen Actors Guild Award]].

In accordance with [[Lee Strasberg]]'s [[method acting]], Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting ''Gia'', she told her husband, [[Jonny Lee Miller]], that she would not be able to phone him: "I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://angelanna3.tripod.com/interviews2000/id12.html |title=Star Light, Star Bright – Hollywood's shining starlets |magazine=Pavement |date=February–March 2000 |accessdate=December 29, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020212160112/http://angelanna3.tripod.com/interviews2000/id12.html | archive-date=February 12, 2002 | url-status=live }}</ref> After ''Gia'' [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]], she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had "nothing else to give."<ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic" /> She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at [[New York University]] to study directing and screenwriting.<ref name="Angelina Jolie: Body Beautiful" /> Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for ''George Wallace'' and the positive critical reception of ''Gia'', Jolie resumed her career.<ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic" />

Following the previously filmed gangster film ''[[Hell's Kitchen (1998 film)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in ''[[Playing by Heart]]'' (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included [[Sean Connery]], [[Gillian Anderson]], and [[Ryan Phillippe]]. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' critic Peter Stack wrote, "Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble."<ref>{{cite news |last=Stack |first=Peter |url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Heart-Barely-Misses-a-Beat-Small-life-stories-2951376.php |title='Heart' Barely Misses a Beat |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=January 22, 1999 |accessdate=December 29, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006065820/http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Heart-Barely-Misses-a-Beat-Small-life-stories-2951376.php | archive-date=October 6, 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref> She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the [[National Board of Review]].

In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama ''[[Pushing Tin]]'', alongside [[John Cusack]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], and [[Cate Blanchett]]. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Desson Howe]] dismissed her as "a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home."<ref>{{cite news |last=Howe |first=Desson |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/movies/reviews/pushingtinhowe.htm |title='Pushing Tin': A Bumpy Ride |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=April 23, 1999 |accessdate=December 29, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225180421/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/movies/reviews/pushingtinhowe.htm | archive-date=February 25, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> Jolie then co-starred with [[Denzel Washington]] in ''[[The Bone Collector]]'' (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's [[quadriplegic]] detective track down a [[serial killer]].

Jolie next took the supporting role of a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] mental patient in ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' (1999), an adaptation of [[Susanna Kaysen]]'s [[Girl, Interrupted|memoir of the same name]].

In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'', which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.<ref name="Angelina Jolie Movie Box Office Results" /> She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by [[Nicolas Cage]]; ''The Washington Post'' writer [[Stephen Hunter]] criticized that "all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth."<ref>{{cite news |last=Hunter |first=Stephen |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/entertainment/movies/reviews/gonein60secondshunter.htm |title='Gone in 60 Seconds': Lost in the Exhaust |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 9, 2000 |accessdate=December 29, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112114140/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/entertainment/movies/reviews/gonein60secondshunter.htm | archive-date=January 12, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in ''Girl, Interrupted''.

=== 2001–2004: Mainstream recognition ===
Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but ''Lara Croft: Tomb Raider'' (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer [[Lara Croft]].

Jolie's next directorial effort was the marital drama ''[[By the Sea (2015 film)|By the Sea]]'' (2015), in which she starred opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, marking their first collaboration since 2005's ''Mr. & Mrs. Smith''. Based on her screenplay, the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie, who drew inspiration from her own mother's life. Critics, however, dismissed it as a "vanity project," as part of an overall poor reception.<ref name="McClintock">{{cite magazine |first=Pamela |last=McClintock |title=Box-Office Preview: Angelina Jolie Pitt's 'By the Sea' Opts for Limited Release |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 10, 2015 |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/angelina-jolie-pitt-brad-pitts-838686 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119193347/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/angelina-jolie-pitt-brad-pitts-838686 |archive-date=November 19, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |first=David |last=Ehrlich |title='By the Sea' and the Death of the Celebrity Vanity Project |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=November 16, 2015 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/vanity-unfair-by-the-sea-and-the-death-of-the-celebrity-ego-project-20151116 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117184331/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/vanity-unfair-by-the-sea-and-the-death-of-the-celebrity-ego-project-20151116 |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Writing for ''The Washington Post'', Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion, stating, "''By the Sea'' is dazzlingly gorgeous, as are its stars.

As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. ''[[First They Killed My Father (film)|First They Killed My Father]]'' (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's [[Khmer Rouge]] era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend [[Loung Ung]], whose [[First They Killed My Father|memoirs]] about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for [[Netflix]], which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.<ref>{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Borger |title=Among the ghosts of Cambodia's killing fields: on the set of Angelina Jolie's new film |newspaper=The Guardian |date=January 11, 2017 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/11/angelina-jolie-cambodia-first-they-killed-my-father |accessdate=February 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204170715/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/11/angelina-jolie-cambodia-first-they-killed-my-father |archive-date=February 4, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Labeling Jolie as a "skilled and sensitive filmmaker", Rafer Guzmán of ''Newsday'' commended her for "convincingly depict[ing] the illogical hell of the Khmer Rouge era".<ref>{{cite news |first=Rafer |last=Guzmán |title='First They Killed My Father' review: Angelina Jolie film is a horrific history lesson |work=Newsday |date=September 15, 2017 |url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/first-they-killed-my-father-review-angelina-jolie-film-is-a-horrific-history-lesson-1.14176369 |accessdate=July 21, 2019}}</ref> It received nominations for the Golden Globe and [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42618239 |title=Bafta Film Awards 2018: All the nominees |last= |first= |date= |website=BBC|access-date=January 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/golden-globes-2018-nominees/ |title=Golden Globes 2018: The Complete List of Nominees |last=Maglio |first=Tony |website=[[The Wrap]] |date=December 11, 2017 |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref>

After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor [[Billy Bob Thornton]] on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas.

Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the divorce of actors [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]] in October 2005.

Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including ''Lara Croft: Tomb Raider'' (2001) and ''Beowulf'' (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,<ref>{{cite news |last=Seiler |first=Andy |last2=Snider |first2=Mike |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/2001-06-15-lara-croft.htm |newspaper=USA Today |title=Lara Croft's greatest leap |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=January 22, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621154544/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/2001-06-15-lara-croft.htm | archive-date=June 21, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2007/11/sure_beowulf_is_a_technologica.html |title=Yes, 'Beowulf' Is a Technological Marvel — But How Does Angelina Jolie Look Naked? |publisher=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]] |date=November 16, 2007 |accessdate=January 22, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619163140/http://www.vulture.com/2007/11/sure_beowulf_is_a_technologica.html | archive-date=June 19, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> with ''Empire'' stating that her "pneumatic figure", "feline eyes", and "bee-stung lips" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.<ref name="Empire sexiest">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.empireonline.com/100sexiest/default.asp?star=1 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120310214149/http://www.empireonline.com/100sexiest/default.asp?star=1 | url-status=dead | archive-date= March 10, 2012 |title=Angelina Jolie 'Sexiest Movie Star Ever' |magazine=Empire |date=December 5, 2007 |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref> Conversely, ''Salon'' writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's "dark and intense sexuality" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,<ref name="Salon" /> while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in ''Changeling'' (2008), opined that having "the most beautiful face on the planet" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/film/beautiful-face-hampers-jolie-eastwood/2008/10/06/1223145233452.html |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Australian Associated Press |title=Beautiful face hampers Jolie: Eastwood |date=October 6, 2008 |accessdate=January 22, 2015 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924195951/http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/film/beautiful-face-hampers-jolie-eastwood/2008/10/06/1223145233452.html | archive-date= September 24, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, [[AfterEllen]] founder [[Sarah Warn]] observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that "there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does".<ref>{{cite web |last=Warn |first=Sarah |url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/4213-the-angelina-jolie-phenomenon |title=The Angelina Jolie Phenomenon |publisher=AfterEllen |date=July 1, 2002 |accessdate=January 15, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117153150/http://www.afterellen.com/people/4213-the-angelina-jolie-phenomenon | archive-date=January 17, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered "the gold standard of beauty",<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/beauty/jolie-good/2007/04/12/1175971251818.html |title=Everyone wants to look like Jolie |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Australian Associated Press |date=April 12, 2007 |accessdate=January 27, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924195331/http://www.smh.com.au/news/beauty/jolie-good/2007/04/12/1175971251818.html | archive-date=September 24, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Landman |first=Beth |url=https://nypost.com/2013/04/23/nycs-most-wanted-face/ |title=NYC's most wanted face |newspaper=New York Post |date=April 23, 2013 |accessdate=January 27, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128115805/http://nypost.com/2013/04/23/nycs-most-wanted-face/ | archive-date=January 28, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Douglas |first=Joanna |url=https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/everyone-wants-angelina-jolies-lips-kim-109212427563.html |title=Everyone Wants Angelina Jolie's Lips, Kim Kardashian's Eyes, and Brad Pitt's Nose |publisher=Yahoo!
