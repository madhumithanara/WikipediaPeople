'''Tupac Amaru Shakur''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|uː|p|ɑː|k|_|ʃ|ə|ˈ|k|ʊər
}} {{respell|TOO|pahk|_|shə|KOOR}}; born '''Lesane Parish Crooks''', June 16, 1971{{Spaced ndash}}September 13, 1996), better known by his stage name '''2Pac''' and by his alias '''Makaveli''', was an American rapper, songwriter, and actor. He is considered by many to be one of the most influential rappers of all time. Much of Shakur's work has been noted for addressing contemporary social issues that plagued inner cities, and he is considered a symbol of resistance and activism against inequality.

Shakur was born in [[Manhattan]], a borough of [[New York City]], but relocated to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 1988. He moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 1993 to further pursue his music career. By the time he released his debut album ''[[2Pacalypse Now]]'' in 1991, he had become a central figure in [[West Coast hip hop]], introducing social issues in the genre at a time when [[gangsta rap]] was dominant in the mainstream.<ref name="TSTA2">{{Cite video|title=Tupac Shakur – Thug Angel (The Life of an Outlaw)|date=2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|editor1-last=Alexander|editor1-first=Leslie M.|editor2-last=Rucker|editor2-first=Walter C.|title=Encyclopedia of African American History|volume=1|date=February 28, 2010|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=9781851097692|pages=254-257}}</ref> Shakur achieved further critical and commercial success with his follow-up albums ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...]]'' (1993) and ''[[Me Against the World]]'' (1995).<ref name="HTP-3302">Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 330.</ref>

=== Beginnings: 1989–1991 ===
Tupac, using the stage name MC New York, began recording in 1989. That year, he began attending the poetry classes of [[Leila Steinberg]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Leila Steinberg|url=http://www.hearteducation.org/leila.html|publisher=Assemblies in Motion|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213024039/http://www.hearteducation.org/leila.html|archivedate=February 13, 2008|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref> Soon, she became the budding music artist's manager.<ref name=":5" />

Steinberg organized with Tupac's rap group Strictly Dope a concert.

=== Rising star: 1992–1993 ===
2Pac's debut album, ''[[2Pacalypse Now]]''—alluding to the 1979 film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''—arriving in November 1991, would bear three singles.

2Pac's second album, ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...]]'', arrived in February 1993. A critical and commercial advance, it debuted at #24 on the pop albums chart, the [[Billboard 200]]. More hardcore overall, it emphasizes Tupac's sociopolitical views, and has a metallic production quality, in fact featuring [[Ice Cube]], the famed primary creator of N.W.A's "[[Fuck tha Police]]," but who, in his own solo albums, had newly gone militantly [[Political rap|political]], along with L.A.'s original gangsta rapper, [[Ice-T]], who in June 1992 had sparked controversy with his band [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]]'s track "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]," [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].

In fact, in its vinyl release, side A, tracks 1 to 8, is labeled the "Black Side," while side B, tracks 9 to 16, is the "Dark Side." Nonetheless, the album carries the single "[[I Get Around (Tupac Shakur song)|I Get Around]]," a party anthem featuring the Underground's [[Shock G]] and [[Money-B]], which would render 2Pac's popular breakthrough, reaching #11 on the pop singles chart, the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. And it carries the optimistic compassion of another hit, "[[Keep Ya Head Up]]," encouraging women. This album would be [[Certified platinum|certified Platinum]], a million copies sold.

In late 1993, Shakur formed the group [[Thug Life]] with Tyrus "[[Big Syke]]" Himes, Diron "Macadoshis" Rivers, his stepbrother [[Mopreme Shakur]], and Walter "Rated R" Burns. Thug Life released its only album, ''[[Thug Life: Volume 1]]'', on October 11, 1994. It went Gold. It carries the single "Pour Out a Little Liquor", produced by [[Johnny "J"|Johnny "J" Jackson]], who would also produce much of Shakur's album ''All Eyez on Me''. Usually, Thug Life performed live without Tupac.<ref>{{cite video|title=Thug Life: Vol. 1|date=1994|medium=CD}}</ref> The track "Pour Out a Little Liquor" appears also on the 1994 film ''[[Above the Rim]]''<nowiki/>'s soundtrack. But under the heavy criticism of [[gangsta rap]] at the time, the album's original version was scrapped, and the album redone with mostly new tracks. Still, along with Stretch, Tupac would perform the first planned first single, "Out on Bail," which was never released, at the 1994 Source Awards.<ref>{{cite web|title=2Pac – Out On Bail (live 1994)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiubB9awJUA|date=January 8, 2007|publisher=YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226224847/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiubB9awJUA|archivedate=February 26, 2013|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2020}}</ref>

==Film career==
Tupac's first film appearance was in 1991 in ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'', a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] by the Digital Underground. Yet in 1992, he starred in ''[[Juice (film)|Juice]]'', where he plays the fictional Roland Bishop, a violent gang member.

==Criminal cases==
In October 1991, Shakur filed a $10-million lawsuit against the [[Oakland Police Department]] for allegedly brutalizing him over [[jaywalking]]. The case was settled for about $43,000.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/14/arts/tupac-shakur-25-rap-performer-who-personified-violence-dies.html?pagewanted=2 |work=The New York Times |title=Tupac Shakur, 25, Rap Performer Who Personified Violence, Dies |first=Jon |last=Pareles |date=September 14, 1996 |accessdate=May 26, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021051509/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/14/arts/tupac-shakur-25-rap-performer-who-personified-violence-dies.html?pagewanted=2 |archivedate=October 21, 2009}}</ref> Thereafter, he would be involved in a series of cases where he was accused of inflicting harm.

=== Shooting of Qa'id Walker-Teal ===
On August 22, 1992, in Marin City, Shakur performed outdoors at a festival. For about an hour after the performance, he signed autographs and posed for photos. A conflict broke out and Shakur allegedly drew a legally carried [[Colt Mustang]] but dropped it on the ground. Shakur claimed that someone with him then picked it up when it accidentally discharged. About 100 yards (90 meters) away in a schoolyard, Qa'id Walker-Teal, a boy aged 6 on his bicycle, was fatally shot in the forehead.

Police matched the bullet to a [[.38 caliber|.38-caliber]] pistol registered to Shakur. His stepbrother Maurice Harding was arrested, but no charges were filed. Lack of witnesses stymied prosecution. In 1995, Qa'id's mother filed against Shakur a [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death suit]], settled for about $300 000 to $500 000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Marin-slaying-case-against-rapper-opens-3122665.php|title=Marin slaying case against rapper opens |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 3, 1995 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412011323/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Marin-slaying-case-against-rapper-opens-3122665.php |archivedate=April 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Settlement in Rapper's Trial for Boy's Death |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 8, 1995 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PAGE-ONE-Settlement-in-Rapper-s-Trial-For-3019996.php |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513061224/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PAGE-ONE-Settlement-in-Rapper-s-Trial-For-3019996.php |archivedate=May 13, 2013}}</ref>

=== Shooting two policemen ===
In October 1993, in [[Atlanta]], Mark Whitwell and Scott Whitwell, two brothers who were both off-duty police officers, were out celebrating with their wives after one of them had passed the state's bar examination. Drunk, the officers were crossing the street when a passing car carrying Shakur allegedly almost struck them. The Whitwells, later found to have stolen guns, argued with the car's occupants and were soon joined by a second car. Ultimately, Shakur shot one officer in the buttocks and the other in the leg, back, or abdomen. Shakur was charged in the shooting. Mark Whitwell was charged with firing at Shakur's car and later lying to the investigation. Prosecutors dropped all charges against the parties.<ref>Smothers, R., [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC1F3AF931A35752C1A965958260 "Rapper Charged in Shootings of Off-Duty Officers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224152447/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC1F3AF931A35752C1A965958260|date=February 24, 2009}}.

=== Assault convictions ===
On April 5, 1993, charged with felonious assault, Shakur allegedly threw a microphone and swung a baseball bat at rapper Chauncey Wynn, of the group M.A.D.,  at a concert at [[Michigan State University]]. On September 14, 1994, Shakur pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to 30 days in jail, twenty of them suspended, and ordered to 35 hours of community service.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rapper Tupac Shakur to face assault charge|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19940909&id=C0xIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xg4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4115,3582492|accessdate=August 27, 2013|newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner|date=September 9, 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rapper sentenced for assault|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1988&dat=19941101&id=n0AoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YwUGAAAAIBAJ&pg=3900,36494|accessdate=August 27, 2013|newspaper=The Argus|date=November 1, 1994}}</ref>

Slated to star as Sharif in the 1993 [[Hughes Brothers|Hughes brothers]]' film ''[[Menace II Society]]'', Shakur was replaced by actor Vonte Sweet after allegedly assaulting one of the film's directors, Allen Hughes.

===Sexual assault conviction===
[[File:WikiPress 3 Hip Hop (page 188 crop).jpg|thumb|Shakur's 1995 mugshot]]
In November 1993, Shakur and three other men were charged in New York with [[sexual assault|sexually assaulting]] a woman in his hotel room. The woman, Ayanna Jackson, alleged that after consensual oral sex in his hotel room, she returned a later day, but then was raped by him and other men there. Interviewed on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', Shakur said he was hurt that "a woman would accuse me of taking something from her."<ref>{{cite web|title=Tupac Shakur interview with "The Arsenio Hall Show" in 1994 [VIDEO&#93;|url=http://www.hip-hopvibe.com/2012/03/07/tupac-shakur-interview-with-the-arsenio-hall-show-in-1994-video/|author=TBTEntGroup on|date=March 7, 2012|publisher=Hip-hopvibe.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221084324/http://www.hip-hopvibe.com/2012/03/07/tupac-shakur-interview-with-the-arsenio-hall-show-in-1994-video/|archivedate=December 21, 2013|access-date=September 13, 2013}}</ref>

On December 1, 1994, denying that he himself had raped her, Shakur was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse, but acquitted of associated sodomy and gun charges.

==New York scene 1990s==
In 1991, 2Pac debuted on a new record label, [[Interscope Records]], that knew little about rap music. Until that year, [[Ruthless Records]], formed during 1986 in [[County of Los Angeles|Los Angeles county]]'s [[Compton, California|Compton]] city, had prioritized rap, and its group [[N.W.A]] had led gangsta rap to [[Music recording certification|platinum sales]], but N.W.A's lyrics, outrageously violent and misogynist, precluded mainstream breakthrough. On the other hand, also specializing in rap, [[Profile Records]], in New York City, had a mainstream, pop breakthrough, [[Run-DMC]]'s "[[Walk This Way]]”, in 1986. In April 1991, N.W.A disbanded via [[Dr. Dre|Dre. Dre]]'s departure to, with [[Suge Knight]], launch [[Death Row Records]], in [[Los Angeles]] city.<ref name=":4">Derrick Parker with Matt Diehl, ''Notorious C.O.P.: The Inside Story of the Tupac, Biggie, and Jam Master Jay Investigations from the NYPD's First "Hip-Hop Cop"'' (New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=aW1CdaYjwDgC&pg=PA113 pp 113–116].</ref> With it very first two albums, Death Row became the first record label both to prioritize rap and to regularly release mainstream, pop hits with it.<ref name=":4" />

Released by Death Row in late 1992, Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]''—its "[[Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang]]" ubiquitous on pop radio and "[[Let Me Ride]]" winning a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]—was trailed in late 1993 by Snoop's ''[[Doggystyle]]''.<ref name=":4" /> Gangsta rap, no less, these propelled the West Coast, for the first time, ahead of New York to rap's center stage.<ref name=":4" /> But meanwhile, in 1993, [[Andre Harrell]] of [[Uptown Records]], in New York, fired his star [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] man, [[Sean Combs|Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs]], later "P. Diddy."<ref name=":4" /> Puffy, while leaving behind his standout projects [[Jodeci]] and [[Mary J. Blige]]—two R&B acts—took to his own, new record label, [[Bad Boy Records]], the promising gangsta rapper Biggie Smalls, soon also known as [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]<ref name=":4" /> His debut album, released in late 1994 as ''[[Ready to Die]]'', promptly returned rap's spotlight to New York.<ref name=":4" />

=== Rap world ===

==== Stretch and Live Squad ====
In 1988, [[Stretch (rapper)|Randy "Stretch" Walker]], along with his brother, dubbed Majesty, and a friend debuted with an EP as rap group and production team, Live Squad, in [[Queens]], NY.<ref name=":0"> (Queens is a borough of New York City). Charisse Jones, [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/01/nyregion/rapper-slain-after-chase-in-queens.html "Rapper slain after chase In Queens"], ''New York Times'', December 1, 1995, sec B, p 3.</ref> Tupac's early days with [[Digital Underground]] made his acquaintance with Stretch, who featured on a track of the Digital Underground's 1991 album ''[[Sons of the P]]''. Becoming fast friends, Tupac and Stretch recorded and performed together often.<ref name=":0" /> Stretch as well as Live Squad contributed tracks on 2Pac's first two albums, first November 1991, then February 1993, and on 2Pac's side group [[Thug Life]]'s [[Thug Life: Volume 1|only album]] of September 1994.

The end of Tupac's and Stretch's friendship in late 1994 surprised the New York rap scene.<ref name=":0" /> The next 2pac album, released in March 1995, lacks Stretch, and 2Pac's album after that, released in February 1996, has lines suggesting Stretch's impending death for betrayal. No objective evidence would publicly emerge to tangibly incriminate Stretch in the gun attack on Tupac, while with Stretch and two others, at about 12:30 AM on November 30, 1994. In any case, after a Live Squad production session for [[It Was Written|the second album of Queens rapper Nas]], Stretch's vehicle was chased while receiving fatal gunfire at about 12:30 AM on November 30, 1995.<ref name=":0" />

==== Biggie and Junior M.A.F.I.A. ====
During 1993 and 1994, the Biggie Smalls guest verses on several singles, often R&B, like Mary J. Blige's "[[What's the 411? Remix]]," set high expectations for his debut album. The perfectionism of Puffy, still forming his Bad Boy label, extended its recording to 18 months. In 1993, visiting Los Angeles, Biggie asked a local drug dealer for an introduction to Tupac, who then welcomed Biggie and Biggie's friends to Tupac's house and treated them to food, weed, and entertainment.<ref name=":6" /> On later visits to Los Angeles, Biggie would stay at Tupac's place.<ref name=":6" /> And when in New York, Tupac would go to Brooklyn and hang out with Biggie and his circle.<ref name=":6" />

During this period, at his own live shows, Tupac would call Biggie onto stage to rap with him and Stretch.<ref name=":6">Ben Westhoff, [https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gqkqz3/tupac-biggie-friends-to-foes "How Tupac and Biggie went from friends to deadly rivals"], ''[[Vice.com]]'', September 12, 2016.</ref> Together, they recorded the songs "[[Runnin' from tha Police|Runnin' from the Police]]" and "House of Pain." Reportedly, Biggie asked Tupac to manage him, whereupon Tupac advised him that Puffy would make him a star.<ref name=":6" /> Yet in the meantime, Tupac's lifestyle was comparatively lavish, whereas Biggie appeared to continue wearing the same pair of boots for perhaps a year.<ref name=":6" /> Tupac welcomed Biggie to join his side group Thug Life.<ref name=":6" /> Biggie would instead form his own side group, the [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.]], with his Brooklyn friends [[Lil' Cease]] and [[Lil' Kim]], on Bad Boy.

=== Underworld ===
Despite the "weird" timing of Stretch's shooting death,<ref name=":0" /> a theory implicates gunman Ronald "Tenad" Washington both here and in the 2002 murder of Run-DMC's [[Jam Master Jay]] via, as the unverified theory speculates, [[Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff]] punishing the rap mentor for recording [[50 Cent]] despite Supreme's prohibition after this young rapper's 1999 song "[[Ghetto Qu'ran (Forgive Me)|Ghetto Qu'ran]]" had mentioned activities of the Queens drug gang Supreme Team.<ref name=":9">Melissa Ursula Dawn Goldsmith, "Jam Master Jay", in M. Goldsmith & Anthony J. Fonseca, eds., ''Hip Hop around the World: An Encyclopedi''a (Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2019), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6mR2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA364&dq=Stretch+Tenad+Supreme+Jam++Cent p 364].</ref> Supreme was a friend, rather, of [[Irv Gotti]], cofounder of [[Murder Inc Records]],<ref name=":9" /> whose rapper [[Ja Rule]] would vie among New York rappers after the March 1997 shooting death of Biggie, visiting Los Angeles.

==== Haitian Jack ====
By some accounts, the role Birdie, played by Shakur in the 1994 film ''[[Above the Rim]]'', had been modeled on a New York underworld tough, [[Jacques Agnant|Jacques "Haitian Jack" Agnant]],<ref name=":7">Jason Rodriguez, [https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2011/09/pit-of-snakes-2pacs-quad-studios-shooting-excerpt-from-sept-2011-issue "Pit of snakes"], ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' magazine, Sep 2011.</ref> a manager and promoter of rappers.<ref>Lesley Goldberg, [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/haitian-jack-hip-hop-miniseries-works-967201 "Haitian Jack hip-hop miniseries in the works (exclusive)"], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', January 23, 2017.</ref> Reportedly, Shakur met him at a Queens nightclub, where, noticing him amid women and champagne, Shakur asked for an introduction.<ref name=":6" /> Reportedly, Biggie advised Tupac to avoid him, but Tupac disregarded the warning.<ref name=":6" /> 

In November 1993, in his Manhattan hotel room, Shakur received a woman's return visit. Soon, she alleged sexual assault by him and three other men there: his road manager Charles Fuller, aged 24, one Ricardo Brown, aged 30,<ref>Craig Wolff, [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/20/nyregion/rap-performer-is-charged-in-midtown-sex-attack.html "Rap performer is charged In Midtown sex attack"], ''New York Times'', November 20, 1993, § 1, p 25.</ref> and a "Nigel," later understood as Haitian Jack.<ref name=":6" /> In November 1994, Jack's case was split off and closed via misdemeanor plea without incarceration.<ref name=":6" /> In 2007, for shooting at someone, he would be deported.<ref>David Metzler, director, [[Soledad O'Brien]] & [[Ice-T]], interviewers, "Haitian Jack", interviewee, ''Who Shot Biggie & Tupac?''

Benza]], in the New York [[Daily News (New York)|''Daily News'']], reported Tupac's new disdain for Jack.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7" />

==== Jimmy Henchman ====
Through Haitian Jack, Tupac had met [[Jimmy Henchman|James "Jimmy Henchman" Rosemond]].<ref name=":6" /> Another underworld figure formidable, Jimmy Henchman doubled as music manager.<ref name=":7" /> [[Bryce Wilson]]'s [[Groove Theory]] was an early client.<ref name=":7" /> [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] as well as [[Gucci Mane]] were later clients.<ref name=":7" /> In 1994, a client lesser known, and signed to [[Uptown Records]], was rapper [[Little Shawn]], friend of Biggie and Lil' Cease.<ref name=":7" /> Eventually, Jack and Henchman would reportedly fall out, allegedly shooting at each other in Miami.<ref name=":7" /> And for his major drug trafficking, Henchman would be sent to prison on a life sentence.<ref name=":7" /> But in the early 1990s, Jack and Henchman reputedly shared interests, including a specialty of robbing and extorting music artists.<ref name=":7" />

== Shootings of Shakur ==
=== November 1994 ===
On November 29, 1994, while in New York, Tupac was recording verses for a mixtape of Ron G.<ref name=":7" /> Tupac was repeatedly distracted by his beeper.<ref name=":7" /> It was music manager James "Jimmy Henchman" Rosemond, reportedly offering $7 000 for Tupac to stop by Quad Studios, in Times Square, that night to record a verse for his client Little Shawn.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7" /> Tupac was leery, but needing cash to offset steepening legal costs, took the gig. Tupac arrived with Stretch and one or two others. In the lobby, three men attempted to rob Tupac at gunpoint, Tupac resisted and was shot.<ref name="Jimmy Henchman review">{{cite news |last=Samaha |first=Albert |title=James Rosemond, Hip-Hop Manager Tied to Tupac Shooting, Gets Life Sentence for Drug Trafficking |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/10/james_rosemond_life_sentence_drug_trafficking_tupac_shooting_ties.php |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |work=[[Village Voice]] |location=New York City |date=October 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030071331/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/10/james_rosemond_life_sentence_drug_trafficking_tupac_shooting_ties.php |archivedate=October 30, 2013}}</ref> Shakur speculated that shooting was the main motive.<ref>{{cite web|first=Chuck|last=Philips |title=Tupac Interview 1995 recording |url=http://chuckphilipspost.com |publisher=Chuck Philips Post |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054645/http://chuckphilipspost.com/ |archivedate=September 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/30/nyregion/rap-artist-tupac-shakur-shot-in-robbery.html |title=Rap Artist Tupac Shakur Shot in Robbery |date=November 30, 1994 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215031012/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/30/nyregion/rap-artist-tupac-shakur-shot-in-robbery.html |archivedate=February 15, 2017}}</ref>

Three hours after surgery, against doctor's advice, Shakur checked out of [[Bellevue Hospital Center]]. The next day, in a Manhattan courtroom bandaged in a wheelchair, he received the jury's verdict in his ongoing criminal trial for a November 1993 sexual assault in his hotel room. Convicted of three counts of sexual assault, he was acquitted of six other charges, including sodomy and gun charges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digtriad.com/news/watercooler/article.aspx?storyid=118215&catid=176|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221012035/http://www.digtriad.com/news/watercooler/article.aspx?storyid=118215&catid=176|url-status=dead|title=Today In Entertainment History February 6|archivedate=February 21, 2009}}</ref>

Tupac became convinced that Stretch had likely been somehow privy to the impending hit. Present during its unfolding, Stretch had shown atypical tolerance for and exemption from it, Tupac felt. But Tupac accused James "Jimmy Henchman" Rosemond, rather, of arranging the hit. Further, Tupac was convinced the Bad Boy record label's inner circle, especially its star rapper Christopher "Biggie" Wallace and label's boss Sean "Puffy" Combs, two who had seemed Tupac's friends, had certainly been privy.

During 1995, imprisoned, impoverished, and his mother about to lose her house, Tupac had his wife Keisha Morris get word to Marion "Suge" Knight, in Los Angeles, boss of [[Death Row Records]].<ref name=":6" /> Reportedly, Tupac's mother promptly received $15,000.<ref name=":6" /> After an August visit to [[Clinton Correctional Facility]] in northern New York state, Suge traveled southward to New York City to join Death Row's entourage to the 2nd Annual Source Awards ceremony.<ref name=":6" /> Already reputed for strongarm tactics on the Los Angeles rap scene, Suge used his brief stage time mainly to belittle [[Sean Combs|Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs]], boss of Bad Boy Entertainment, the label then leading New York rap scene, who routinely performed with his own artists.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":10" /> Before closing with a brief comment of support for Tupac,<ref name=":11">Nadirah Simmons, [https://thesource.com/2016/08/03/today-in-1995-the-2nd-annual-source-awards-makes-hip-hop-history "Today in 1995: The 2nd Annual Source Awards makes hip hop history"], ''[[The Source]]'', August 3, 2016.</ref> Suge invited artists seeking the spotlight for themselves to join Death Row.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":10">Erika Ramirez, [https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6363520/throwback-thursday-suge-knight-diddy-1995-source-awards "Throwback Thursday: Suge Knight Disses Diddy at 1995 Source Awards"], ''Billboard.com'', December 4, 2014.</ref> Eventually, Puff recalled that to preempt severe retaliation from his Bad Boy orbit, he had promptly confronted Suge, whose reply—that he had meant [[Jermaine Dupri]], of [[So So Def Recordings]], in Atlanta—was politic enough to deescalate the conflict.<ref name=":8">Peter A.

Still, among the fans, the previously diffuse [[East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry|rivalry between America's only two mainstream rap scenes]] had instantly flared already.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":11" /><ref name=":10" /> And while in New York, Suge visited [[Uptown Records]], where Puff, under its founder [[Andre Harrell]], had started in the music business through an [[internship]].<ref name=":14">Randall Sullivan, ''LAbyrinth: The True Story of City of Lies, the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. and the Implication of the Los Angeles Police Department'' (New York: Grove Press, 2018), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wq7SDwAAQBAJ&q=Newsweek noting ''Newsweek'' report].</ref> Apparently without paying Uptown, Suge obtained the releases of Puff's prime Uptown recruits [[Jodeci]], its producer [[DeVante Swing]], and [[Mary J.

And with appeal of his December 1994 conviction pending, Shakur returned to Los Angeles and joined Death Row.<ref name=":4" /> On June 4, 1996, it released the 2Pac [[A-side and B-side|B side]] "[[Hit 'Em Up]]." In this venonmous tirade, the proclaimed "Bad Boy killer" threatens violent payback on all things Bad Boy—Biggie, Puffy, [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.|Junior M.A.F.I.A]]., the company—and on any in New York's rap scene, like rap duo [[Mobb Deep]] and obscure rapper [[Chino XL]], who allegedly had commented against Shakur about the dispute.
