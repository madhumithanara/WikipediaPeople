At 13, he enrolled in the private [[Lakeside School (Seattle, Washington)|Lakeside prep school]],{{sfn|Manes|1994|p=24}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Soundaian|first=S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nYGcDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA50&dq=bill%20gates%20banned%20for%20summer%20pdp-10&pg=PA50#v=onepage|title=New Dimensions of Management|date=June 10, 2019|publisher=MJP Publisher|language=en}}</ref> where he wrote his first software program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bill-Gates|title=Bill Gates {{!}} American computer programmer, businessman, and philanthropist|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en|access-date=December 7, 2018}}</ref> When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a [[General Electric]] (GE) computer for the students.{{sfn|Manes|1994|p=27}} Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of [[tic-tac-toe]] that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.{{sfn|Gates|1996|p=12}} After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] minicomputers. One of these systems was a [[PDP-10]] belonging to [[Computer Center Corporation]] (CCC) which banned for the summer Gates, [[Paul Allen]], [[Ric Weiland]], and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans, after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.{{sfn|Manes|1994|p=34}}{{r|leibovich20001231}}

The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money.{{r|leibovich20001231}} At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the system remotely via [[Teleprinter|Teletype]], Gates went to CCC's offices and studied [[source code]] for various programs that ran on the system, including [[Fortran]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], and [[machine language]]. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when the company went out of business. 

The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year. Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates has described as one of the saddest days of his life. Gates then turned to Allen who helped him finish the system for Lakeside.<ref name="leibovich20001231" />

Gates read the January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' which demonstrated the [[Altair 8800]], and he contacted [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]] (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a [[BASIC]] interpreter for the platform.<ref name="keyevents">{{cite journal|title=Microsoft Visitor Center Student Information: Key Events in Microsoft History |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |publisher=Microsoft |format=.DOC |accessdate=February 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226224212/http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |archivedate=February 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president [[Ed Roberts (computers)|Ed Roberts]] agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair [[emulator]] that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as [[Altair BASIC]]. MITS hired Allen,<ref name="thocp1">{{cite web|title=Microsoft history |publisher=The History of Computing Project |url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514211138/http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and "software", and their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator [[Ric Weiland]].<ref name="thocp1" /> They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name "Microsoft" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976.<ref name="thocp1" /> Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.

[[Microsoft]]'s Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]] in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=81}} This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.<ref name="thocp1" /> The company moved from Albuquerque to [[Bellevue, Washington]] on January 1, 1979.<ref name="keyevents" />

Gates said he personally reviewed and often rewrote every line of code that the company produced in its first five years. As the company grew he transitioned into a manager role, then an executive.<ref name="waterloo">{{cite speech|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx |last=Gates |first=William 'Bill' |title=Remarks |date=October 13, 2005 |location=Waterloo, ON |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406130809/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx |archivedate=April 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>

===IBM partnership===
[[IBM]], the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the [[IBM PC]].{{r |bunnell1982febmar}} IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to [[Digital Research]] (DRI), makers of the widely used [[CP/M]] operating system.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html|title=Pioneers Die Broke|work=Forbes|first1=John Steele|last1=Gordon|first2=Michael|last2=Maiello|authorlink1=John Steele Gordon|date=December 23, 2002|accessdate=March 31, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029221703/http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html|archivedate=October 29, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, however, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using [[86-DOS]], an operating system similar to CP/M, that [[Tim Paterson]] of [[Seattle Computer Products]] (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patersontech.com/dos/microsoft-micronews.aspx |title=Father of DOS |work=Paterson Technology |accessdate=October 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906120441/http://www.patersontech.com/dos/microsoft-micronews.aspx |archive-date=September 6, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner. Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the PC<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patersontech.com/dos/softalk.aspx |title=The Roots of DOS |work=Paterson Technology |accessdate=October 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906120449/http://www.patersontech.com/dos/softalk.aspx |archive-date=September 6, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and delivered it to IBM as [[PC DOS]] for a one-time fee of $50,000.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 54}}

The contract itself only earned Microsoft a relatively small fee.  It was the prestige brought to Microsoft by IBM's adoption of their operating system that would be the origin of Microsoft's transformation from a small business to the leading software company in the world. Gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM because he believed that other personal computer makers would clone IBM's PC hardware.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 54}} They did, making the IBM-compatible PC, running DOS, a de facto standard. The sales of [[MS-DOS]] (the version of DOS sold to customers other than IBM) made Microsoft a major player in the industry.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=193}} The press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the IBM PC. ''PC Magazine'' asked if Gates was "the man behind the machine?".<ref name="bunnell1982febmar">{{cite news | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&lpg=RA2-PA18&pg=PA16 | title = The Man Behind The Machine? | type = interview | work = PC Magazine | date = Feb–Mar 1982 | accessdate = February 17, 2012 | last = Bunnell | first = David | page = 16 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130509162040/http://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&lpg=RA2-PA18&pg=PA16 | archivedate = May 9, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president and chairman of the board, with Paul Allen as vice president and vice chairman. In early 1983, Allen left the company after receiving a [[Hodgkin lymphoma]] diagnosis, effectively ending the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen, which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft equity.<ref name="keyevents" /><ref name="before microsoft">{{cite magazine|author=Paul Allen|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/05/paul-allen-201105 |title=Microsoft's Odd Couple |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=May 2011 |accessdate=November 11, 2019}}</ref> Later in the decade, Gates repaired his relationship with Allen and together the two donated millions to their childhood school Lakeside.<ref name="leibovich20001231"/> They remained friends until Allen's death in October 2018.<ref name="Gates Mourns Allen">{{Cite news |url=https://fortune.com/2018/10/16/bill-gates-paul-allen-death-microsoft/ |title=Bill Gates Mourns His Microsoft Co-Founder Paul Allen: 'Personal Computing Would Not Have Existed Without Him' |last=Detrick |first=Hallie |date=October 16, 2018 |work=Fortune |access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref>

===Windows===
Microsoft launched its first retail version of [[Microsoft Windows]] on November 20, 1985. In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with [[IBM]] to develop a separate operating system called [[OS/2]]. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://groklaw.net/pdf/iowa/www.iowaconsumercase.org/011607/0000/PX00738.pdf |title=Challenges and Strategy |work=Groklaw |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>

Gates had primary responsibility for Microsoft's product strategy from the company's founding in 1975 until 2006. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; an industry executive complained in 1981 that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls."<ref name="freiberger19810831">{{cite magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA44&pg=PA49 | title=Bugs in Radio Shack TRS-80 Model III: How Bad Are They? | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | last=Freiberger | first=Paul | date=August 31, 1981 | magazine=InfoWorld | page=49 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902132455/https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA44&pg=PA49 | archivedate=September 2, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> An Atari executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times.

During Microsoft's early years, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his primary role in most of the company's history was as a manager and executive.

On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his role at Microsoft to dedicate more time to philanthropy.

===Antitrust litigation===

[[File:US v. Microsoft Bill Gates Color.png|thumb|Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on August 27, 1998]]

Gates approved of many decisions that led to [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] litigation over Microsoft's business practices. In the 1998 ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' case, Gates gave [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner [[David Boies]] over the contextual meaning of words such as "compete", "concerned", and "we". Later in the year, when portions of the videotaped deposition were played back in court, the judge was seen laughing and shaking his head.<ref name="GatesDepositionJudgeLaugh">{{cite news |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html |title=Gates deposition makes judge laugh in court |first=Elizabeth |last=Wasserman |publisher=CNN |date=November 17, 1998 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407052251/http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html |archivedate=April 7, 2013 }}</ref> ''BusinessWeek'' reported:

Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.

According to the [[Bloomberg Billionaires Index]], Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8&nbsp;billion to US$78.5&nbsp;billion. {{as of|2014|January}}, most of Gates's assets are held in [[Cascade Investment]] LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts]], and [[Corbis Corporation|Corbis Corp.]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Billionaires Worth $3.7 Trillion Surge as Gates Wins 2013|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-02/billionaires-worth-3-7-trillion-surge-as-gates-wins-2013.html|accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=January 2, 2014|author=Matthew G.

Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: "...{{nbsp}}there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a [[pandemic]], or nuclear or [[bioterrorism]]." Gates also identified innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that "America's way better today than it's ever been."<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill Gates: The Rolling Stone Interview|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?print=true|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann S.

Gates has expressed concern about the potential harms of [[superintelligence]]; in a [[Reddit]] "ask me anything", he stated that:

Gates studied the work of [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]], and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the "William H. Gates Foundation." In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5&nbsp;billion to create the charitable [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/|title=Gates foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523010101/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/|archivedate=May 23, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundsforngos.org/all-listings/worlds-top-ten-wealthiest-charitable-foundations/|title=The Top Ten US Charitable Foundations|author=Robin Toal|date=September 16, 2013|work=Funds For NGOs|publisher=Funds For NGOs, LLC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407081521/http://www.fundsforngos.org/all-listings/worlds-top-ten-wealthiest-charitable-foundations/|archivedate=April 7, 2014|url-status=live|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}</ref> The foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the [[Wellcome Trust]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3913581.stm|title=Bill Gates: billionaire philanthropist|author=Cronin, Jon|date=January 25, 2005|accessdate=April 1, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015134954/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3913581.stm|archivedate=October 15, 2007|url-status=live|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/|title=Our Approach to Giving|publisher=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404212231/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/|archivedate=April 4, 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> Gates, through his foundation, also donated $20&nbsp;million to [[Carnegie Mellon University]] for a new building to be named Gates Center for Computer Science which opened in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Speeches/2009/09/Bill-Gates-Carnegie-Mellon-University|title=Bill Gates - Carnegie Mellon University|author=|date=|website=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|accessdate=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cmu.edu/engage/partner/foundations/highlighted-partnerships/gates-center.html|title=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Builds Carnegie Mellon's Home for Computer Science - Engage with CMU - Carnegie Mellon University|first=Carnegie Mellon|last=University|date=|website=cmu.edu|accessdate=January 27, 2019}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Gates stated in regard to his faith: "The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief."<ref name="God" />

Gates also said: "I agree with people like [[Richard Dawkins]] that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm&nbsp;– not all&nbsp;– that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know."<ref name="God">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?page=5|title=Bill Gates: The Rolling Stone Interview|last=Goodell|first=Jeff|date=March 27, 2014|magazine=Rolling Stone|accessdate=April 14, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509035553/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?page=5|archivedate=May 9, 2014}}</ref>
