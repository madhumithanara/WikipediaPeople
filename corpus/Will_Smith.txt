==Career==
{{see also|Will Smith filmography|Will Smith discography|List of awards and nominations received by Will Smith}}

===1985–1992: The Fresh Prince===
[[File:Will Smith - Emmy Awards 1993.jpg|thumb|right|Smith at the Emmy Awards in 1993]]

Smith started as the [[MC#Hip hop|MC]] of the hip-hop duo [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]], with his childhood friend [[DJ Jazzy Jeff|Jeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes]] as [[turntablist]] and producer.<ref name=tca>Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2002</ref> Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing his [[hype man]]. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.<ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Jazz Jeff Interview Made From Scratch |publisher=DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince Fan Site |url=http://www.jazzyjefffreshprince.com/interviews/dj-jazzy-jeff/jazzy-jeff-made-from-scratch.htm |accessdate=May 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516163814/http://www.jazzyjefffreshprince.com/interviews/dj-jazzy-jeff/jazzy-jeff-made-from-scratch.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}</ref>

Soon after, the two decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes (Ready Rock C), making them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Up Records released their first single in late 1985 to 1986 when [[A&R]] man [[Paul Oakenfold]]<ref>[http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C Paul Oakenfold] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429072412/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C |date=April 29, 2008 }}</ref> introduced them to Word Up with their single "[[Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble]]," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/ProfQuater/Jazzy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201090331/http://members.aol.com/ProfQuater/Jazzy.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 1, 2007|title=D.J. Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince|date=December 1, 2007|accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref> The song sampled the theme song of "[[I Dream of Jeannie]]." Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.<ref name=sickening>{{cite news |title = Will Smith: My Work Ethic Is "Sickening" |publisher = CBS |url = https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/30/60minutes/main3558937_page2.shtml |accessdate = May 14, 2008 |date=November 30, 2007}}</ref>

Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention of [[Jive Records]] and [[Russell Simmons]]. The duo's first album, ''[[Rock the House (album)|Rock the House]]'', which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in March 1987. The group received the first [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance]] in 1989 for "[[Parents Just Don't Understand]]" (1988), though their most successful single was "[[Summertime (DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince song)|Summertime]]" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smith's solo performer credit.<ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince to reunite? |publisher=://URLFan |url=http://www.urlfan.com/local/dj_jazzy_jeff_and_the_fresh_prince_to_reunite/76504345.html |accessdate=May 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707061753/http://www.urlfan.com/local/dj_jazzy_jeff_and_the_fresh_prince_to_reunite/76504345.html |archivedate=July 7, 2008 }}</ref>

Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes.<ref name=tca/> The [[Internal Revenue Service]] eventually assessed a $2.8&nbsp;million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and [[garnishment|garnished]] his income.<ref>{{cite interview|first=Will|last=Smith|interviewer=[[Steve Kroft]]|title=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS|date=December 2, 2007}}</ref>
Smith was struggling financially in 1990, when the [[NBC]] television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', around him.<ref name=tca/> The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming "the biggest movie star in the world", studying [[List of highest-grossing films|box office successes]]' common characteristics.<ref name="Keegan" />

In 1989, Smith was arrested in relation to an alleged assault on his record promoter, William Hendricks, but all charges were dismissed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://atlantablackstar.com/2014/08/27/7-celebrities-never-knew-criminal-records/|title=7 Celebrities You Never Knew Had Criminal Records|first=Megan|last=Reed|date=August 27, 2014|accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref>

In the summer of 1997, he starred alongside [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in the hit ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'', playing [[Agent J]]. The film was released on July 2 by [[Columbia Pictures]] and grossed over $589.3&nbsp;million worldwide against a $90&nbsp;million budget, becoming the year's third highest-grossing film, with an estimated 54,616,700 tickets sold in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=meninblack.htm&adjust_yr=1&p=.htm|title=Men in Black|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=May 30, 2016|date=May 30, 2016}}</ref> It received worldwide acclaim, with critics highly praising its humor, as well as Jones and Smith's performances.

During the summer of 1997, Smith also began his solo music career with the release of "[[Men in Black (song)|Men in Black]]", the theme song for the film, which topped singles charts in several regions across the world, including the UK.<ref name="UK">{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/3466/will-smith/ |title=Will Smith Full Official Chart History |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate=April 10, 2016 }}</ref> "Men in Black" (and second single "[[Just Cruisin']]") was later included on Smith's debut solo album ''[[Big Willie Style]]'', which reached the top ten of the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified nine times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref name="US200">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/431377/will-smith/chart?f=305 |title=Billboard 200: Will Smith Chart History |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |accessdate=April 10, 2016 }}</ref><ref name="RIAA">{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Will+Smith#search_section |title=Gold & Platinum Artist Search "Will Smith" |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=April 10, 2016 }}</ref> The third single from the album, "[[Gettin' Jiggy wit It]]", became Smith's first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one when it was released in 1998.<ref name="US100">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/431377/will-smith/chart?f=379 |title=The Hot 100: Will Smith Chart History |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |accessdate=April 10, 2016 }}</ref>
