'''Stephen William Hawking''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CH|CBE|FRS|FRSA}} (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]], [[cosmology|cosmologist]], and [[author]] who was director of research at the [[Centre for Theoretical Cosmology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] at the time of his death.<ref name="Auto2J-2" /><ref name="Auto2J-3" /><ref name=rsbm>{{cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=Bernard J.|last2=Ellis|first2=George F.

Hawking was born in [[Oxford]] into a family of doctors. Hawking began his university education at [[University College, Oxford]] in October 1959 at the age of 17, where he received a [[First Class Honours#First-class honours|first-class]] [[Honours degree|BA (Hons.) degree]] in physics. He began his graduate work at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] in October 1962, where he obtained his [[PhD]] degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology in March 1966.

In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of [[motor neurone disease]] (also known as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease) that gradually paralysed him over the decades.<ref>{{cite news|date=26 November 2015|title=Mind over matter: How Stephen Hawking defied Motor Neurone Disease for 50 years|work=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/mind-over-matter-how-stephen-hawking-defied-motor-neurone-disease-for-50-years-6286313.html|url-status=live|access-date=15 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823050027/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/mind-over-matter-how-stephen-hawking-defied-motor-neurone-disease-for-50-years-6286313.html|archive-date=23 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite news|date=7 January 2012|title=How Has Stephen Hawking Lived to 70 with ALS?|work=[[Scientific American]]|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stephen-hawking-als/|url-status=live|access-date=23 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830050822/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stephen-hawking-als/|archive-date=30 August 2015|quote=Q: How frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of ALS? A: I would say probably less than a few percent.}}</ref> After the loss of his speech, he was able to communicate through a [[speech-generating device]]—initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.

Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with [[Roger Penrose]] on [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems|gravitational singularity theorems]] in the framework of [[general relativity]] and the theoretical prediction that [[black hole]]s emit radiation, often called [[Hawking radiation]]. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the [[general theory of relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. He was a vigorous supporter of the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]].<ref>[[Gardner, Martin]] (September/October 2001).

Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of [[popular science]] in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' appeared on the ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], a lifetime member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]], and a recipient of the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the [[BBC]]'s poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]]. He died on 14 March 2018 at the age of 76, after living with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years.

In 1950, when Hawking's father became head of the division of [[parasitology]] at the [[National Institute for Medical Research]], the family moved to [[St Albans]], [[Hertfordshire]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xiii}} In St Albans, the family was considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=12}} meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}} They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house and travelled in a converted London taxicab.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=22–23}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=11–12}} During one of Hawking's father's frequent absences working in Africa,{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=13}} the rest of the family spent four months in [[Majorca]] visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet [[Robert Graves]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=3}}

=== Primary and secondary school years ===
Hawking began his schooling at the [[Byron House School]] in [[Highgate]], London. He later blamed its "[[progressive education|progressive methods]]" for his failure to learn to read while at the school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-12-07/stephen-hawking-im-happy-if-i-have-added-something-to-our-understanding-of-the-universe|title=Stephen Hawking: "I'm happy if I have added something to our understanding of the universe"|first=Stephen|last=Hawking|date=7 December 2013|website=Radio Times|access-date=6 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107095605/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-12-07/stephen-hawking-im-happy-if-i-have-added-something-to-our-understanding-of-the-universe|archive-date=7 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}} In St Albans, the eight-year-old Hawking attended [[St Albans High School for Girls]] for a few months. At that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=3}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=24}}

Hawking attended two [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent (i.e. fee-paying) schools]], first Radlett School{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=24}} and from September 1952, [[St Albans School, Hertfordshire|St Albans School]],<ref name=whoswho />{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=8}} after passing the [[eleven-plus]] a year early.<ref>My brief history – Stephen Hawking (2013).</ref> The family placed a high value on education.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}} Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded [[Westminster School]], but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=7–8}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=4}} A positive consequence was that Hawking remained close to a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=25–26}} and long discussions about Christianity and [[extrasensory perception]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=14–16}} From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher [[Dikran Tahta]], they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=19–20}}

Although known at school as "Einstein", Hawking was not initially successful academically.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=25}} With time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and, inspired by Tahta, decided to read mathematics at university.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=17–18}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=27}}<ref name="Auto2J-5" /> Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=41}} He also wanted his son to attend [[University College, Oxford]], his own ''[[alma mater]]''. As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time, Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry. Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=27–28}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=42–43}}

=== Undergraduate years ===
Hawking began his university education at [[University College, Oxford]],<ref name=whoswho /> in October 1959 at the age of 17.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=28}} For the first 18 months, he was bored and lonely{{snd}}he found the academic work "ridiculously easy".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=46–47, 51}} His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, "It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=29}} A change occurred during his second and third year when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort "to be one of the boys". He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=28}} Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the [[University College Boat Club (Oxford)|University College Boat Club]], where he [[coxswain (rowing)|coxed]] a rowing crew.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=30–31}}{{sfn|Hawking|1992|loc=p. 44}} The rowing coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=30–31}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=50}} Hawking estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his [[final examination|finals]] a challenge, and he decided to answer only [[theoretical physics]] questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours degree]] was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in [[cosmology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=53}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}} Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a ''[[oral exam|viva]]'' (oral examination) with the Oxford examiners necessary.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=54}}

Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at the viva to describe his plans, he said, "If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=54–55}} He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners "were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}} After receiving a [[First Class Honours#First-class honours|first-class]] [[Honours degree|BA (Hons.) degree]] in physics and completing a trip to [[Iran]] with a friend, he began his graduate work at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], in October 1962.<ref name=whoswho />{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=56}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=31–32}}

=== Graduate years ===
Hawking's first year as a doctoral student was difficult. He was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned [[Dennis William Sciama]], one of the founders of modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather than noted Yorkshire astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=33}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=58}} and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in [[general relativity]] and cosmology.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=33–34}} After being diagnosed with [[motor neurone disease]], Hawking fell into a depression{{snd}}though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=61–63}} His disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted. Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and his speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded. With Sciama's encouragement, he returned to his work.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=36}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=69–70}} Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student [[Jayant Narlikar]] at a lecture in June 1964.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=42}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=68–69}}

When Hawking began his graduate studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the [[Big Bang]] and [[Steady State theory|Steady State]] theories.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=34}} Inspired by [[Roger Penrose]]'s theorem of a [[spacetime]] singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe; and, during 1965, he wrote his thesis on this topic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/stephen-hawkings-phd-thesis-explained-simply|title=Stephen Hawking's PhD thesis, explained simply|access-date=27 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213201244/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/stephen-hawkings-phd-thesis-explained-simply|archive-date=13 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=71–72}} Hawking's thesis<ref name=hawkingphd /> was approved in 1966.<ref name="hawkingphd" /> There were other positive developments: Hawking received a research fellowship at [[Gonville and Caius College]] at Cambridge;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=43–44}} he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology, in March 1966;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=47}} and his essay "Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year's prestigious [[Adams Prize]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xix}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=47}}

=== 1966–1975 ===
In his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems|singularity theorem]] concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis. This included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity. Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 [[Gravity Research Foundation]] competition.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=101}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=61, 64}} In 1970, they published a proof that if the universe obeys [[general relativity|the general theory of relativity]] and fits any of the [[Friedmann equations|models]] of [[physical cosmology]] developed by [[Alexander Friedmann]], then it must have begun as a singularity.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=64–65}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=115–16}}<ref name="Auto2J-7" /> In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created Fellowship for Distinction in Science to remain at Caius.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=49}}

In 1970, Hawking postulated what became known as [[Second law of black hole mechanics|the second law of black hole dynamics]], that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=65–67}} With [[James M. Bardeen]] and [[Brandon Carter]], he proposed the four [[laws of black hole mechanics]], drawing an analogy with [[thermodynamics]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=38}} To Hawking's irritation, [[Jacob Bekenstein]], a graduate student of [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]], went further—and ultimately correctly—to apply thermodynamic concepts literally.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=67–68}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=123–24}}

In the early 1970s, Hawking's work with Carter, Werner Israel, and David C. Robinson strongly supported Wheeler's [[no-hair theorem]], one that states that no matter what the original material from which a black hole is created, it can be completely described by the properties of [[mass]], [[electrical charge]] and rotation.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=33}}<ref name="HawkingIsrael1989" /> His essay titled "Black Holes" won the [[Gravity Research Foundation]] Award in January 1971.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=35}} Hawking's first book, ''[[The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time]],'' written with [[George Francis Rayner Ellis|George Ellis]], was published in 1973.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=68}}

Beginning in 1973, Hawking moved into the study of [[quantum gravity]] and [[quantum mechanics]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=39}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=68}} His work in this area was spurred by a visit to Moscow and discussions with [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] and [[Alexei Starobinsky]], whose work showed that according to the [[uncertainty principle]], rotating black holes emit particles.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=146}} To Hawking's annoyance, his much-checked calculations produced findings that contradicted his second law, which claimed black holes could never get smaller,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=70}} and supported Bekenstein's reasoning about their [[Black hole entropy|entropy]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=146}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=41}}

His results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit radiation, known today as [[Hawking radiation]], which may continue until they exhaust their energy and [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporate]].<ref name="Auto2J-9" /><ref name="Auto2J-10" />{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=69–73}} Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=70–74}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=42–43}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=150–51}} Hawking was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1974|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974]], a few weeks after the announcement of Hawking radiation. At the time, he was one of the youngest scientists to become a Fellow.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=44}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=133}}

Hawking was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Visiting Professorship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) in 1974. He worked with a friend on the faculty, [[Kip Thorne]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=82, 86}}<ref name=rsbm/> and engaged him in a [[scientific wager]] about whether the [[Astrophysical X-ray source|X-ray source]] [[Cygnus X-1]] was a black hole. The wager was an "insurance policy" against the proposition that black holes did not exist.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=86–88}} Hawking acknowledged that he had lost the bet in 1990, a bet that was the first of several he was to make with Thorne and others.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=150,189, 219}} Hawking had maintained ties to Caltech, spending a month there almost every year since this first visit.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=95}}

=== 1975–1990 ===
Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a more academically senior post, as [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in gravitational physics. The mid to late 1970s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and the physicists who were studying them. Hawking was regularly interviewed for print and television.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=90}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=132–33}} He also received increasing academic recognition of his work.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}} In 1975, he was awarded both the [[Eddington Medal]] and the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences|Pius XI Gold Medal]], and in 1976 the [[Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics|Dannie Heineman Prize]], the [[Maxwell Medal and Prize]] and the [[Hughes Medal]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=162}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xv}} He was appointed a professor with a chair in [[gravitational physics]] in 1977.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=91}} The following year he received the [[Albert Einstein Medal]] and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}}

In 1979, Hawking was elected [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the University of Cambridge.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}}<ref name=lucasian>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3248858/Stephen-Hawking-to-retire-as-Cambridges-Professor-of-Mathematics.html|title=Stephen Hawking to retire as Cambridge's Professor of Mathematics|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=15 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316023008/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3248858/Stephen-Hawking-to-retire-as-Cambridges-Professor-of-Mathematics.html|archive-date=16 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> His inaugural lecture in this role was titled: "Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics?" and proposed [[N=8 Supergravity]] as the leading theory to solve many of the outstanding problems physicists were studying.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=93–94}} His promotion coincided with a health crisis which led to his accepting, albeit reluctantly, some nursing services at home.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=92–93}} At the same time, he was also making a transition in his approach to physics, becoming more intuitive and speculative rather than insisting on mathematical proofs. "I would rather be right than rigorous", he told Kip Thorne.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=96}} In 1981, he proposed that information in a black hole is irretrievably lost when a black hole evaporates. This [[Black hole information paradox|information paradox]] violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, and led to years of debate, including "[[the Black Hole War]]" with [[Leonard Susskind]] and [[Gerard 't Hooft]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=96–101}}<ref name="Susskind2008" />

[[Inflation (cosmology)|Cosmological inflation]]{{snd}}a theory proposing that following the Big Bang, the universe initially expanded incredibly rapidly before settling down to a slower expansion{{snd}}was proposed by [[Alan Guth]] and also developed by [[Andrei Linde]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=108–11}} Following a conference in Moscow in October 1981, Hawking and [[Gary Gibbons]]<ref name=rsbm/> organised a three-week Nuffield Workshop in the summer of 1982 on "The Very Early Universe" at Cambridge University, a workshop that focused mainly on inflation theory.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=111–14}}<ref name="Auto2J-12" /><ref name="Auto2J-13" /> Hawking also began a new line of quantum theory research into the origin of the universe. In 1981 at a Vatican conference, he presented work suggesting that there might be no boundary{{snd}}or beginning or ending{{snd}}to the universe.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=102–103}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=180}}

Hawking subsequently developed the research in collaboration with [[James Hartle|Jim Hartle]],<ref name=rsbm/> and in 1983 they published a model, known as the [[Hartle–Hawking state]]. It proposed that prior to the [[Planck epoch]], the [[universe]] had no boundary in space-time; before the Big Bang, time did not exist and the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless.<ref name="Auto2J-14" /> The initial singularity of the classical Big Bang models was replaced with a region akin to the North Pole. One cannot travel north of the North Pole, but there is no boundary there{{snd}}it is simply the point where all north-running lines meet and end.{{sfn|Baird|2007|loc=p. 234}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=180–83}} Initially, the no-boundary proposal predicted a [[Shape of the universe|closed universe]], which had implications about the existence of God. As Hawking explained, "If the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained... then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=129}}

Hawking did not rule out the existence of a Creator, asking in ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' "Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?"{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=130}} In his early work, Hawking spoke of God in a metaphorical sense. In ''A Brief History of Time'' he wrote: "If we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason{{snd}}for then we should know the mind of God."<ref name="sample" /> In the same book he suggested that the existence of God was not necessary to explain the origin of the universe. Later discussions with [[Neil Turok]] led to the realisation that the existence of God was also compatible with an open universe.{{sfn|Yulsman|2003|loc=pp.&nbsp;174–176}}

Further work by Hawking in the area of [[Arrow of time|arrows of time]] led to the 1985 publication of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=180–182}} A paper by Don Page and independent calculations by [[Raymond Laflamme]] led Hawking to withdraw this concept.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=182}} Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American [[Franklin Medal]],{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=274}} and in the [[1982 New Year Honours]] appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE).{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=x–xix}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=114}}<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=48837 |date=30 December 1981 |page=8 |supp=y}}</ref> These awards did not significantly change Hawking's financial status, and motivated by the need to finance his children's education and home expenses, he decided in 1982 to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=134–35}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=205, 220–21}} Instead of publishing with an academic press, he signed a contract with [[Bantam Books]], a mass market publisher, and received a large advance for his book.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=134}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=220–27}} A first draft of the book, called ''A Brief History of Time'', was completed in 1984.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=135}}

One of the first messages Hawking produced with his [[speech-generating device]] was a request for his assistant to help him finish writing ''A Brief History of Time''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=175}} Peter Guzzardi, his editor at Bantam, pushed him to explain his ideas clearly in non-technical language, a process that required many revisions from an increasingly irritated Hawking.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=140–42}} The book was published in April 1988 in the US and in June in the UK, and it proved to be an extraordinary success, rising quickly to the top of best-seller lists in both countries and remaining there for months.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=143}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=243–45}}<ref name="g2009" /> The book was translated into many languages,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=143–44}} and ultimately sold an estimated 9{{nbsp}}million copies.<ref name="g2009" />

Media attention was intense,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=143–44}} and a ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine cover and a television special both described him as "Master of the Universe".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=146}} Success led to significant financial rewards, but also the challenges of celebrity status.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=145–46}} Hawking travelled extensively to promote his work, and enjoyed partying and dancing into the small hours.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=143–44}} A difficulty refusing the invitations and visitors left him limited time for work and his students.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=149}} Some colleagues were resentful of the attention Hawking received, feeling it was due to his disability.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=147–48}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=230–31}}

He received further academic recognition, including five more honorary degrees,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=146}} the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] (1985),{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xvi}} the [[Dirac Prize|Paul Dirac Medal]] (1987){{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=146}} and, jointly with Penrose, the prestigious [[Wolf Prize]] (1988).{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=279}} In the [[1989 Birthday Honours]], he was appointed a [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Companion of Honour]] (CH).{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=149}}<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=48837 |date=16 June 1989 |page=18 |supp=y}}</ref> He reportedly declined a knighthood in the late 1990s in objection to the UK's science funding policy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/3344540/Stephen-Hawking-warns-Government-over-disastrous-science-funding-cuts.html|title=Stephen Hawking warns Government over 'disastrous' science funding cuts|author=Tom Peterkin|date=15 June 2008|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2 April 2018|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402225846/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/3344540/Stephen-Hawking-warns-Government-over-disastrous-science-funding-cuts.html|archive-date=2 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/science/why-professor-stephen-hawking-never-had-a-knighthood/|title=Why Professor Stephen Hawking never had a knighthood|author=Sally Guyoncourt|date=14 March 2018|work=I News|access-date=15 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616001932/https://inews.co.uk/news/science/why-professor-stephen-hawking-never-had-a-knighthood/|archive-date=16 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Hawking pursued his work in physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on [[Euclidean quantum gravity]] with Gary Gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=180}} In 1994, at Cambridge's [[Newton Institute]], Hawking and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures that were published in 1996 as "The Nature of Space and Time".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=188}} In 1997, he conceded a 1991 public [[scientific wager]] made with Kip Thorne and [[John Preskill]] of [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Hawking had bet that Penrose's proposal of a "cosmic censorship conjecture"{{snd}}that there could be no "naked singularities" unclothed within a horizon{{snd}}was correct.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=189–90}}

After discovering his concession might have been premature, a new and more refined wager was made. This one specified that such singularities would occur without extra conditions.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=190}} The same year, Thorne, Hawking and Preskill made another bet, this time concerning the [[black hole information paradox]].<ref name="Auto2J-18" /><ref name="concedbet" /> Thorne and Hawking argued that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate and lose information, the mass-energy and information carried by Hawking radiation must be "new", and not from inside the black hole [[event horizon]]. Since this contradicted the quantum mechanics of microcausality, quantum mechanics theory would need to be rewritten. Preskill argued the opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time, the concept of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way.<ref name="presskill" />

Hawking also maintained his public profile, including bringing science to a wider audience. A film version of ''A Brief History of Time'', directed by [[Errol Morris]] and produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], premiered in 1992. Hawking had wanted the film to be scientific rather than biographical, but he was persuaded otherwise. The film, while a critical success, was not widely released.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=168–70}} A popular-level collection of essays, interviews, and talks titled ''[[Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays]]'' was published in 1993,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=178}} and a six-part television series ''[[Stephen Hawking's Universe]]'' and a companion book appeared in 1997. As Hawking insisted, this time the focus was entirely on science.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=189}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=97}}

Hawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing ''[[The Universe in a Nutshell]]'' in 2001,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=199–200}} and ''[[A Briefer History of Time (Hawking and Mlodinow book)|A Briefer History of Time]]'', which he wrote in 2005 with [[Leonard Mlodinow]] to update his earlier works with the aim of making them accessible to a wider audience, and ''[[God Created the Integers]]'', which appeared in 2006.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=222–23}} Along with Thomas Hertog at [[CERN]] and Jim Hartle, from 2006 on Hawking developed a theory of {{anchor|Top-down cosmology}}"top-down cosmology", which says that the universe had not one unique initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that predicts the universe's current configuration from one particular initial state.<ref name="Auto2J-23" /> Top-down cosmology posits that the present "selects" the past from a superposition of many possible histories. In doing so, the theory suggests a possible resolution of the [[Fine-tuned universe|fine-tuning question]].<ref name="dt70" /><ref name="Auto2J-24" />

Hawking continued to travel widely, including trips to Chile, [[Easter Island]], South Africa, Spain (to receive the [[Fonseca Prize]] in 2008),{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=233}}<ref name="Auto2J-29" /> Canada,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=239}} and numerous trips to the United States.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=269}} For practical reasons related to his disability, Hawking increasingly travelled by private jet, and by 2011 that had become his only mode of international travel.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=197,269}}

By 2003, consensus among physicists was growing that Hawking was wrong about the loss of information in a black hole.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=216–17}} In a 2004 lecture in Dublin, he conceded his 1997 bet with Preskill, but described his own, somewhat controversial solution to the information paradox problem, involving the possibility that black holes have more than one [[topology]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=217–20}}<ref name=presskill /> In the 2005 paper he published on the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without such loss.<ref name="concedbet" />{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=223–24}} In January 2014, he called the alleged loss of information in black holes his "biggest blunder".<ref>{{cite news |last=Kwong |first=Matt |date=28 January 2014 |title=Stephen Hawking's black holes 'blunder' stirs debate |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/stephen-hawking-s-black-holes-blunder-stirs-debate-1.2514299 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |access-date=14 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317142127/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/stephen-hawking-s-black-holes-blunder-stirs-debate-1.2514299 |archive-date=17 March 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

As part of another longstanding scientific dispute, Hawking had emphatically argued, and bet, that the [[Higgs boson]] would never be found.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=95, 236}} The particle was proposed to exist as part of the [[Higgs field]] theory by [[Peter Higgs]] in 1964. Hawking and Higgs engaged in a heated and public debate over the matter in 2002 and again in 2008, with Higgs criticising Hawking's work and complaining that Hawking's "celebrity status gives him instant credibility that others do not have."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=94–95, 236}} The particle was discovered in July 2012 at [[CERN]] following construction of the [[Large Hadron Collider]]. Hawking quickly conceded that he had lost his bet<ref name="Auto2J-42" /><ref name="Auto2J-43" /> and said that Higgs should win the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]],<ref name="Auto2J-44" /> which he did in 2013.<ref>{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |date=8 October 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24445325 |title=Higgs: Five decades of noble endeavour |work=BBC News |access-date=10 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611120757/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24445325 |archive-date=11 June 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

On 28 June 2009, as a tongue-in-cheek test of his 1992 conjecture that travel into the past is effectively impossible, Hawking held a party open to all, complete with hors d'oeuvres and iced champagne, but publicised the party only after it was over so that only time-travellers would know to attend; as expected, nobody showed up to the party.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Billings|first1=Lee|title=Time Travel Simulation Resolves 'Grandfather Paradox'|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-travel-simulation-resolves-grandfather-paradox/|access-date=2 September 2016|work=[[Scientific American]]|date=2 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904053855/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-travel-simulation-resolves-grandfather-paradox/|archive-date=4 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages ===
Hawking met his future wife, [[Jane Hawking|Jane Wilde]], at a party in 1962. The following year, Hawking was diagnosed with [[motor neuron disease]]. In October 1964, the couple became engaged to marry, aware of the potential challenges that lay ahead due to Hawking's shortened life expectancy and physical limitations.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=37–40}} Hawking later said that the engagement gave him "something to live for".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=40}} The two were married on 14 July 1965 in their shared hometown of St Albans.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=43–44}}

The couple resided in Cambridge, within Hawking's walking distance to the [[Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics]] (DAMTP). During their first years of marriage, Jane lived in London during the week as she completed her degree at [[Westfield College]]. They travelled to the United States several times for conferences and physics-related visits. Jane began a PhD programme through Westfield College in [[Medieval Spanish literature#Lyric poetry of the Middle Ages|medieval Spanish poetry]] (completed in 1981). The couple had three children: Robert, born May 1967,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=45–47}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=92–98}} [[Lucy Hawking|Lucy]], born November 1969,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=65}} and Timothy, born April 1979.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}}

Hawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges, even{{snd}}in a precedent set during their courtship{{snd}}with Jane.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=37–39, 77}} His disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=78}} Upon his appointment in 1974 to a year-long position at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in [[Pasadena, California]], Jane proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student live with them and help with his care. Hawking accepted, and [[Bernard Carr]] travelled with them as the first of many students who fulfilled this role.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=82–83}}<ref name="black" /> The family spent a generally happy and stimulating year in Pasadena.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=83–88}}

Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a new home and a new job, as [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]]. [[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]], with whom Hawking had begun a close friendship at Caltech, arrived to work as the live-in graduate student assistant. With Page's help and that of a secretary, Jane's responsibilities were reduced so she could return to her doctoral thesis and her new interest in singing.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp = 89–90}}

Around December 1977, Jane met organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones when singing in a church choir. Hellyer Jones became close to the Hawking family, and by the mid-1980s, he and Jane had developed romantic feelings for each other.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=91}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xiv, 79}}{{sfn|Hawking|2007|pp=279–80}} According to Jane, her husband was accepting of the situation, stating "he would not object so long as I continued to love him".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=91}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=79}}{{sfn|Hawking|2007|p=285}} Jane and Hellyer Jones were determined not to break up the family, and their relationship remained platonic for a long period.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=91–92}}

By the 1980s, Hawking's marriage had been strained for many years. Jane felt overwhelmed by the intrusion into their family life of the required nurses and assistants.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp = 164–65}} The impact of his celebrity was challenging for colleagues and family members, while the prospect of living up to a worldwide fairytale image was daunting for the couple.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 185}}<ref name="dt70" /> Hawking's views of religion also contrasted with her strong Christian faith and resulted in tension.<ref name="dt70" />{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp = 80–81}}<ref name="obs2004" /> After a tracheotomy in 1985, Hawking required a nurse 24/7 and nursing care was split across 3 shifts daily. In the late 1980s, Hawking grew close to one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, to the dismay of some colleagues, caregivers, and family members, who were disturbed by her strength of personality and protectiveness.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 145}} In February 1990, Hawking told Jane that he was leaving her for Mason,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 165}} and departed the family home.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp = x–xix}} After his divorce from Jane in 1995, Hawking married Mason in September,{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp = x–xix}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp = 186–87}} declaring, "It's wonderful{{snd}}I have married the woman I love."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 187}}

In 1999, Jane Hawking published a memoir, ''Music to Move the Stars'', describing her marriage to Hawking and its breakdown. Its revelations caused a sensation in the media but, as was his usual practice regarding his personal life, Hawking made no public comment except to say that he did not read biographies about himself.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=187, 192}} After his second marriage, Hawking's family felt excluded and marginalised from his life.<ref name=obs2004 /> For a period of about five years in the early 2000s, his family and staff became increasingly worried that he was being physically abused.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=197}} Police investigations took place, but were closed as Hawking refused to make a complaint.<ref name= sundaytimes />

In 2006, Hawking and Mason quietly divorced,<ref name="Auto2J-25" />{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=225}} and Hawking resumed closer relationships with Jane, his children, and his grandchildren.<ref name="dt70" />{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=225}} Reflecting on this happier period, a revised version of Jane's book, re-titled ''Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen'', appeared in 2007,<ref name="sundaytimes" /> and was made into a film, ''[[The Theory of Everything (2014 film)|The Theory of Everything]]'', in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eddie Redmayne wins first Oscar for 'Theory of Everything'|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-awards-oscars-actor/eddie-redmayne-wins-first-oscar-for-theory-of-everything-idUSKBN0LR0AF20150223|access-date=7 March 2015|agency=Reuters|date=10 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201132243/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-awards-oscars-actor/eddie-redmayne-wins-first-oscar-for-theory-of-everything-idUSKBN0LR0AF20150223|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Disability ===
Hawking had a rare early-onset slow-progressing form of [[motor neuron disease]] (MND; also known as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), or [[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease), a fatal [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease that results in the death of motor neurones in the brain and spinal cord, which gradually paralysed him over decades.<ref name=":0" />

Hawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during his final year at Oxford, including a fall on some stairs and difficulties when rowing.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=32}}<ref name="Auto2J-6" /> The problems worsened, and his speech became slightly [[dysarthria|slurred]] and his family noticed the changes when he returned home for Christmas, and medical investigations were begun.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=59}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=34–35}} The MND diagnosis came when Hawking was 21, in 1963. At the time, doctors gave him a life expectancy of two years.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=18–19}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=59–61}}

In the late 1960s, Hawking's physical abilities declined: he began to use crutches and could no longer give lectures regularly.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=48–49}} As he slowly lost the ability to write, he developed compensatory visual methods, including seeing equations in terms of geometry.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=76–77}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=124–25}} The physicist [[Werner Israel]] later compared the achievements to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] composing an entire symphony in his head.<ref name="Auto2J-8" />{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=124}} Hawking was fiercely independent and unwilling to accept help or make concessions for his disabilities. He preferred to be regarded as "a scientist first, popular science writer second, and, in all the ways that matter, a normal human being with the same desires, drives, dreams, and ambitions as the next person."{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=viii}} His wife, [[Jane Hawking]], later noted: "Some people would call it determination, some obstinacy. I've called it both at one time or another."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=48}} He required much persuasion to accept the use of a wheelchair at the end of the 1960s,{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=117}} but ultimately became notorious for the wildness of his wheelchair driving.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=162}} Hawking was a popular and witty colleague, but his illness, as well as his reputation for brashness, distanced him from some.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=48}}

When Hawking first began using a wheelchair in the late 1970s he was using standard motorised models. The earliest surviving example of these chairs was made by BEC Mobility and sold by Christie's in November 2018 for £296,750.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/shoulders-giants-newton-darwin-einstein-hawking/motorised-wheelchair-52/62112 |title=A motorised wheelchair |date=November 2018 |access-date=18 June 2019}}</ref> Hawking continued to use this type of chair until the early 1990s, at which time his ability to use his hands to drive a wheelchair deteriorated. Hawking used a variety of different chairs from that time, including a DragonMobility Dragon elevating powerchair from 2007, as shown in the April 2008 photo of Hawking attending NASA's 50th anniversary;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/50th/NASA_lecture_series/hawking.html |title=NASA Lecture Series – Dr. Stephen Hawking |date=21 April 2008 |access-date=18 June 2019}}</ref> a Permobil C350 from 2014; and then a Permobil F3 from 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.accessandmobilityprofessional.com/exclusive-stephen-hawkings-powerchair-provider-permobil-pays-tribute-physics-titan/ |title=Stephen Hawking's powerchair provider Permobil pays tribute to physics titan |date=15 March 2018 |access-date=18 June 2019}}</ref>

Hawking's speech deteriorated, and by the late 1970s he could be understood by only his family and closest friends. To communicate with others, someone who knew him well would interpret his speech into intelligible speech.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=81–82}} Spurred by a dispute with the university over who would pay for the ramp needed for him to enter his workplace, Hawking and his wife campaigned for improved access and support for those with disabilities in Cambridge,{{sfn|Mialet|2003|pp=450–51}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=79, 149}} including adapted student housing at the university.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=273–74}} In general, Hawking had ambivalent feelings about his role as a [[disability rights]] champion: while wanting to help others, he also sought to detach himself from his illness and its challenges.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=193–94}} His lack of engagement in this area led to some criticism.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=194}}

During a visit to [[CERN]] on the border of France and Switzerland in mid-1985, Hawking contracted [[pneumonia]], which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated. She refused, but the consequence was a [[tracheotomy]], which required round-the-clock nursing care and the removal of what remained of his speech.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=135–36}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=232–36}} The [[National Health Service]] was ready to pay for a [[nursing home]], but Jane was determined that he would live at home. The cost of the care was funded by an American foundation.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=136–37}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=235–36}} Nurses were hired for the three shifts required to provide the round-the-clock support he required. One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=139}}

For his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose [[Partner-assisted scanning|letters on a spelling card]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=136}} but in 1986 he received a computer program called the "Equalizer" from Walter Woltosz, CEO of Words Plus, who had developed an earlier version of the software to help his mother-in-law, who also suffered from ALS and had lost her ability to speak and write.<ref name="Medeiros" /> In a method he used for the rest of his life, Hawking could now simply press a switch to select phrases, words or letters from a bank of about 2,500–3,000 that were [[Switch access scanning|scanned]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=137–38}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=236–37}} The program was originally run on a desktop computer. Elaine Mason's husband, David, a computer engineer, adapted a small computer and attached it to his wheelchair.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=140}}

Released from the need to use somebody to interpret his speech, Hawking commented that "I can communicate better now than before I lost my voice."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=140–41}} The voice he used had an American accent and is no longer produced.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=138}}<ref name="Auto2J-15" /> Despite the later availability of other voices, Hawking retained this original voice, saying that he preferred it and identified with it.<ref name="Auto2J-16" /> Originally, Hawking activated a switch using his hand and could produce up to [[Typing#Alphanumeric entry|15 words a minute]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=175}} Lectures were prepared in advance and were sent to the [[speech synthesis|speech synthesizer]] in short sections to be delivered.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=138}}

Hawking gradually lost the use of his hand, and in 2005 he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=224}}<ref name="tech" /><ref name="hacked" /> with a rate of about one word per minute.<ref name="tech" /> With this decline there was a risk of his developing [[locked-in syndrome]], so Hawking collaborated with [[Intel]] researchers on systems that could translate his [[Neural oscillation|brain patterns]] or facial expressions into switch activations. After several prototypes that did not perform as planned, they settled on an adaptive word predictor made by the London-based startup [[SwiftKey]], which used a system similar to his original technology. Hawking had an easier time adapting to the new system, which was further developed after inputting large amounts of Hawking's papers and other written materials and uses predictive software similar to other smartphone keyboards.<ref name="dt70" /><ref name="Medeiros">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/intel-gave-stephen-hawking-voice/|title=How Intel Gave Stephen Hawking a Voice|first=Joao|last=Medeiros|date=13 January 2015|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=14 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314050104/https://www.wired.com/2015/01/intel-gave-stephen-hawking-voice/|archive-date=14 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="hacked" /><ref name="start" />

By 2009, he could no longer drive his wheelchair independently, but the same people who created his new typing mechanics were working on a method to drive his chair using movements made by his chin. This proved difficult, since Hawking could not move his neck, and trials showed that while he could indeed drive the chair, the movement was sporadic and jumpy.<ref name="Medeiros" />{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=240}} Near the end of his life, Hawking experienced increased breathing difficulties, often resulting in his requiring the usage of a [[ventilator]], and being regularly hospitalised.<ref name="dt70" />

=== Disability outreach ===
Starting in the 1990s, Hawking accepted the mantle of role model for disabled people, lecturing and participating in fundraising activities.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=164, 178}} At the turn of the century, he and eleven other luminaries signed the ''Charter for the Third Millennium on Disability'', which called on governments to prevent disability and protect the rights of the disabled.<ref name="Auto2J-19" />{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=196}} In 1999, Hawking was awarded the [[Lilienfeld Prize|Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize]] of the [[American Physical Society]].<ref name="Auto2J-20" />

In August 2012, Hawking narrated the "Enlightenment" segment of the [[2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony]] in London.<ref name="Auto2J-54" /> In 2013, the biographical documentary film ''[[Hawking (2013 film)|Hawking]]'', in which Hawking himself is featured, was released.<ref name="NYT-20130913" /> In September 2013, he expressed support for the legalisation of [[assisted suicide]] for the terminally ill.<ref name="Auto2J-55" /> In August 2014, Hawking accepted the [[Ice Bucket Challenge]] to promote ALS/MND awareness and raise contributions for research. As he had pneumonia in 2013, he was advised not to have ice poured over him, but his children volunteered to accept the challenge on his behalf.<ref name="Auto2J-57" />

=== Plans for a trip to space ===
[[File:Physicist Stephen Hawking in Zero Gravity NASA.jpg|alt=Hawking, without his wheelchair, floating weightless in the air inside a plane|thumb|upright=1.15|Hawking taking a zero-gravity flight in a [[reduced-gravity aircraft]], April 2007]]
In late 2006, Hawking revealed in a BBC interview that one of his greatest unfulfilled desires was to travel to space;<ref name="Auto2J-32" /> on hearing this, [[Sir Richard Branson]] offered a free flight into space with [[Virgin Galactic]], which Hawking immediately accepted. Besides personal ambition, he was motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities.<ref name=nyt2007 /> On 26 April 2007, Hawking flew aboard a [[reduced-gravity aircraft|specially-modified]] Boeing 727-200 jet operated by [[Zero Gravity Corporation|Zero-G Corp]] off the coast of Florida to experience weightlessness.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=232–33}} Fears the manoeuvres would cause him undue discomfort proved groundless, and the flight was extended to eight parabolic arcs.<ref name="Auto2J-32" /> It was described as a successful test to see if he could withstand the g-forces involved in space flight.<ref name = "Leonard2007">{{cite news | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1549898/Branson-to-help-Hawking-live-space-dream.html | title =Branson to help Hawking live space dream | last1 =Leonard | first1 =T. | last2 =Osborne | first2 =A. | date =27 April 2007 | website =The Telegraph | access-date =15 March 2018 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20180316081851/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1549898/Branson-to-help-Hawking-live-space-dream.html | archive-date =16 March 2018 | url-status=live | df =dmy-all }}</ref> At the time, the date of Hawking's trip to space was projected to be as early as 2009, but commercial flights to space did not commence before his death.<ref name = "Dean2018">{{cite web | url = https://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2018/03/14/stephen-hawking-experienced-freedom-weightlessness-during-kennedy-space-center-visit/424663002/ | title = Stephen Hawking felt freedom of weightlessness during KSC visit | last = Dean | first = James | date = 14 March 2018 | website = USA Today | access-date = 15 March 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180315200338/https://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2018/03/14/stephen-hawking-experienced-freedom-weightlessness-during-kennedy-space-center-visit/424663002/ | archive-date = 15 March 2018 | url-status=live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The equation's most fundamental implication can be obtained as follows. According to thermodynamics, this temperature is associated with an [[entropy]], <math>S</math>, such that <math>T = M c^2/2 S,</math> where <math>M c^2</math> is the energy of a (nonspinning) black hole as expressed with [[Mass–energy equivalence|Einstein's formula]].<ref name="Walecka2007">{{cite book|last= Walecka|first=John Dirk|title=Introduction to General Relativity|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2V-ulG8RMtoC&pg=PA305|year= 2007|publisher= World Scientific|isbn=978-981-270-584-6|page= 305}}</ref> Combining equations then gives:

:<math>S_\text{BH} = \frac{k c^3}{4 \hbar G} A,</math>

where the subscript BH stands for either "black hole" or "Bekenstein–Hawking". This can be expressed more simply as a proportionality between two [[dimensionless]] ratios:

:<math>\frac{S_\text{BH}}{k} = \frac{1}{4} \frac{A}{A_\text{P}},</math>

where <math>A_\text{P} = \hbar G / c^3</math> is the [[Planck units#Derived units|Planck area]] (the unit of area in quantum mechanics). Use of [[Planck units]] (in which <math>k</math> and <math>A_\text{P}</math> are set to unity) reduces it further to:

:<math>S_\text{BH} = \frac{A}{4}.</math>

[[Jacob Bekenstein]] had conjectured the proportionality; Hawking confirmed it and established the constant of proportionality at <math>1/4</math>.<ref name="Guardian.Death" /><ref name="Auto2J-10" /> Calculations based on [[string theory]], first carried out in 1995, have been found to yield the same result.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Strominger | first1 = A.| last2 = Vafa | first2 = C.| title = Microscopic origin of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy| journal = Physics Letters B| volume = 379| issue = 1–4| pages = 99–104| year = 1996| doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(96)00345-0|arxiv = hep-th/9601029 |bibcode = 1996PhLB..379...99S }}</ref>

This relationship is conjectured to be valid not just for black holes, but also (since [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy is proportional to information]]) as an [[Bekenstein bound|upper bound]] on the amount of information that can be contained in any volume of space, which has in turn spawned deeper reflections on the possible [[Holographic principle|nature of reality]].}} In June 2018, it was announced that Hawking's words, set to music by Greek composer [[Vangelis]], would be beamed into space from a European space agency satellite dish in Spain with the aim of reaching the nearest black hole, [[A0620-00|1A 0620-00]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Stephen Hawking's words will be beamed into space |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-44481914 |accessdate=20 October 2018 |agency=BBC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022020836/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-44481914 |archive-date=22 October 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

In 2006, Hawking posed an open question on the Internet: "In a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race sustain another 100 years?", later clarifying: "I don't know the answer. That is why I asked the question, to get people to think about it, and to be aware of the dangers we now face."<ref>{{cite news |last=Sample |first=Ian |date=2 August 2006 |title=The great man's answer to the question of human survival: Er, I don't know |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/aug/03/scientists.spaceexploration |work=The Guardian |access-date=14 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314230514/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/aug/03/scientists.spaceexploration |archive-date=14 March 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Hawking stated that, given the vastness of the universe, [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] likely exist, but that contact with them should be avoided.<ref name="Auto2J-30" /><ref name="alien" /> He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. In 2010 he said, "If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans."<ref name="alien" />

Hawking warned that [[superintelligent]] [[artificial intelligence]] could be pivotal in steering humanity's fate, stating that "the potential benefits are huge... Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history.

Hawking was concerned about the future emergence of a race of "superhumans" that would be able to design their own evolution<ref name="WP-20181015" /> and, as well, argued that [[computer virus]]es in today's world should be considered a new form of life, stating that "maybe it says something about human nature, that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. Talk about creating life in our own image."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=179}}

=== Science vs. philosophy ===
At Google's Zeitgeist Conference in 2011, Hawking said that "philosophy is dead". He believed that philosophers "have not kept up with modern developments in science" and that scientists "have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge". He said that [[List of unsolved problems in philosophy|philosophical problems]] can be answered by science, particularly new scientific theories which "lead us to a new and very different picture of the universe and our place in it".<ref name="Auto2J-53" />

=== Religion and atheism ===
Hawking was an [[Atheism|atheist]]<ref name="atheist"/><ref name="Auto2J-52" /> and believed that "the universe is governed by the laws of science". He stated: "There is a fundamental difference between religion, which is based on authority, [and] science, which is based on observation and reason. Science will win because it works."<ref name=Hollowverse>{{cite web|url=https://hollowverse.com/stephen-hawking/|title=Stephen Hawking's Religion and Political Views|publisher=Hollowverse|access-date=14 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314104915/https://hollowverse.com/stephen-hawking/|archive-date=14 March 2018|url-status=live}}{{self-published inline|date=March 2018}}</ref> In an interview published in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Hawking regarded "the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail", and the concept of an [[afterlife]] as a "fairy story for people afraid of the dark".<ref name="NYT=20180314" /><ref name="sample" /> In 2011, narrating the first episode of the American television series ''[[Curiosity (TV series)|Curiosity]]'' on the [[Discovery Channel]], Hawking declared:

{{quote|We are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realisation. There is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful.<ref name="Auto2J-50" /><ref name="Auto2J-51" />}}

Hawking's association with atheism and [[freethinking]] was in evidence from his university years onwards, when he had been a member of Oxford University's [[secular humanism|humanist]] group. He was later scheduled to appear as the keynote speaker at a 2017 [[Humanists UK]] conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2018/03/14/humanists-uk-mourns-death-of-stephen-hawking/|title=Humanists UK mourns death of Stephen Hawking|accessdate=18 March 2019|work=[[Humanists UK]]|date=14 March 2019}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', he said:

{{quote|Before we understand science, it is natural to believe that God created the universe. But now science offers a more convincing explanation. What I meant by 'we would know the mind of God' is, we would know everything that God would know, if there were a God, which there isn't. I'm an atheist.<ref name="atheist">{{cite news|last1=Boyle|first1=Alan|title='I'm an Atheist': Stephen Hawking on God and Space Travel|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/im-atheist-stephen-hawking-god-space-travel-n210076|access-date=12 January 2017|publisher=NBC News|date=23 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125223518/http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/im-atheist-stephen-hawking-god-space-travel-n210076|archive-date=25 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

In addition, Hawking stated:
{{quote|If you like, you can call the laws of science 'God', but it wouldn't be a personal God that you would meet and put questions to.<ref name="WP-20181015" />}}

=== Politics ===
Hawking was a longstanding [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] supporter.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=195}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=223}} He recorded a tribute for the 2000 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Al Gore]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=195}} called the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] a "[[war crime]]",{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=223}}<ref name="Auto2J-34" /> supported the [[academic boycott of Israel]],<ref name="Auto2J-35" /><ref name="NYT-20130508" /> campaigned for [[nuclear disarmament]],{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=195}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=223}} and supported [[stem cell]] research,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=223}}<ref name="Auto2J-37" /> [[universal health care]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=242}} and action to prevent [[climate change]].<ref name=ind2007 /> In August 2014, Hawking was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on that issue]].<ref name="Auto2J-56" /> Hawking believed a [[United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union]] (Brexit) would damage the UK's contribution to science as modern research needs international collaboration, and that free movement of people in Europe encourages the spread of ideas.<ref>{{cite news |last=Radford |first=Tim |date=31 May 2016 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/31/stephen-hawking-donald-trump-popularity-inexplicable-and-brexit-spells-disaster |title=Trump's popularity inexplicable and Brexit spells disaster, says Stephen Hawking |work=The Guardian |access-date=31 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531170538/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/31/stephen-hawking-donald-trump-popularity-inexplicable-and-brexit-spells-disaster |archive-date=31 May 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Hawking was disappointed by Brexit and warned against envy and isolationism.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43399019|title=Stephen Hawking's political views|date=14 March 2018|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317031315/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43399019|archive-date=17 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Hawking was greatly concerned over health care, and maintained that without the UK [[National Health Service]], he could not have survived into his 70s.<ref name="bbc20/8/2017" /> He stated, "I have received excellent medical attention in Britain, and I felt it was important to set the record straight. I believe in universal health care. And I am not afraid to say so."<ref name=Hollowverse />

Hawking received numerous awards and honours. Already early in the list, in 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] (FRS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=Bernard J.|last2=Ellis|first2=George F. R.|last3=Gibbons|first3=Gary W.|date=2019|title=Stephen William Hawking CH CBE. 8 January 1942—14 March 2018|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume=66|doi=10.1098/rsbm.2019.0001|pages=267–308}}</ref> At that time, his nomination read:

{{quote|Hawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity. These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy, and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques. Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established, partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must possess singularities. Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase. In collaboration with G. Ellis, Hawking is the author of an impressive and original treatise on "Space-time in the Large".}}

The citation continues, "Other important work by Hawking relates to the interpretation of cosmological observations and to the design of gravitational wave detectors."<ref name="royal" />

Hawking received the 2015 [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] in Basic Sciences shared with [[Viatcheslav Mukhanov]] for discovering that the galaxies were formed from quantum fluctuations in the early Universe. At the 2016 [[Pride of Britain Awards]], Hawking received the lifetime achievement award "for his contribution to science and British culture".<ref name="Corkery"/> After receiving the award from Prime Minister [[Theresa May]], Hawking humorously requested that she not seek his help with [[Brexit]].<ref name="Corkery">{{cite news |last=Corkery |first=Claire |date=1 November 2016 |title=Pride of Britain 2016: Stephen Hawking makes Brexit joke at PM Theresa May's expense |url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/727766/Pride-of-Britain-awards-2016-Stephen-Hawking-Brexit-Theresa-May-Carol-Vorderman |work=Express |access-date=14 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315070543/https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/727766/Pride-of-Britain-awards-2016-Stephen-Hawking-Brexit-Theresa-May-Carol-Vorderman |archive-date=15 March 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>
