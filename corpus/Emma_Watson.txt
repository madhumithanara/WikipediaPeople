In 1999, casting began for ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', the film adaptation of British author [[J. K. Rowling]]'s best-selling [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|novel]]. Casting agents found Watson through her Oxford theatre teacher, and producers were impressed by her confidence. After eight auditions, producer [[David Heyman]] told Watson and fellow applicants [[Daniel Radcliffe]] and [[Rupert Grint]] that they had been cast in the roles of the school friends [[Hermione Granger]], [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and [[Ron Weasley]], respectively. Rowling supported Watson from her first [[screen test]].<ref name=emmaemma /><!-- cites previous 4 sentences -->

In 2004, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' was released.

With ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' (2005), both Watson and the ''Harry Potter'' film series reached new milestones. The film set records for a ''Harry Potter'' opening weekend, a non-May opening weekend in the US, and an opening weekend in the UK.
