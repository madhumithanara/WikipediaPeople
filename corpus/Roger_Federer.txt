===2005: Consolidating dominance===

Federer also took four ATP Masters Series 1000 wins: Indian Wells, Miami and Cincinnati on hard court, and Hamburg on clay.<ref name=RF2005/> The win in Miami was particularly noteworthy as it was the first final contested between Federer and Nadal. Federer recovered from two sets and a break down to take the final in five sets.

Federer won 11 singles titles, which ties his 2004 season.

===2006: Career-best season===
{{Main|2006 Roger Federer tennis season}}
The 2006 season was statistically the best season of Federer's career.

===2007: Holding off young rivals===
{{Main|2007 Roger Federer tennis season}}
In 2007, Federer reached all four Grand Slam singles finals, winning three of them again. He won the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]] without dropping a set, beating [[Fernando González]] in the final. This made him the first man in the 21st century to accomplish the feat, as [[Björn Borg]] at the 1980 French Open was the last to win a Grand Slam tournament without the loss of a set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/aus07/news/story?id=2744992|title=Federer defeats Gonzalez for 10th Grand Slam title|date=28 January 2007|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref> Federer had entered the year on a huge winning streak and after capturing his fourth Dubai crown Federer's winning streak stood at 41 matches, the longest of his career and only five shy of the record.

During the clay season, Federer's victory in the Hamburg Masters final was particularly impressive, as it snapped Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set [[Bagel (tennis)|bagel]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=2007-05-20|title=Federer ends Nadal's clay streak in Hamburg|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-men-masters-idUSL2034409220070520|access-date=2020-06-07}}</ref> At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in a repeat of the previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/scores/2007/520/MS001/match-stats|title=Rafael Nadal VS.

At [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Federer entered the tournament not only as the four-time defending champion, but also riding a 48-match winning streak on grass. Once again, he defeated Rafael Nadal for a second consecutive year in the final, this time in a [[2007 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles final|thrilling five-set encounter]] that many analysts hailed as the greatest Wimbledon final since [[1980 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles final|1980]]. Victory at Wimbledon equaled him with [[Björn Borg]] for the record of five consecutive championships at the [[All England Club]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=agencies|first=Staff and|date=2007-07-08|title=Wimbledon: Roger Federer beats Rafael Nadal to win the men's singles final|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/08/tennis.wimbledon7|access-date=2020-06-07|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

Federer reached the final in Montreal before playing a young and relatively unknown Serbian named [[Novak Djokovic]]. Djokovic proved his potential by beating the world No. 1 in a final-set tiebreaker upset. Federer rebounded in Cincinnati to capture his fifth title of the year. Federer entered the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] as the three-time defending champion and faced Djokovic in the final.

The emergence of countryman [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] as a Grand Slam singles champion in 2014 renewed hope for Federer in his Davis Cup quest, and the pair both committed to playing each tie that year. Their commitment paid off as wins over [[Serbia Davis Cup team|Serbia]], [[Kazakhstan Davis Cup team|Kazakhstan]] and [[Italy Davis Cup team|Italy]] allowed the Swiss team to advance to the [[2014 Davis Cup]] Final. Leading into the final, Federer was suffering from a back injury<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/nov/20/roger-federer-davis-cup-final-switzerland-france-stan-wawrinka|title=Roger Federer's back problem leaves Davis Cup final on knife edge|first=Kevin|last=Mitchell|date=20 November 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> that threw serious doubt over Switzerland's chance to claim the title, and a second rubber straight sets loss to [[Gaël Monfils]] seemingly spelled the worst for Switzerland. However, a rejuvenated Federer returned the next day to help claim the doubles rubber, which set up a fourth rubber singles tie between Federer and [[Richard Gasquet]].

==International representation==
===Laver Cup===
Federer founded the [[Laver Cup]], which pits Europe against the rest of the world. The tournament is named in honor of [[Rod Laver]] and the inaugural edition was played in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Clarey|first=Christopher|date=2017-09-20|title=For Laver Cup, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal Are on the Same Side|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/sports/tennis/laver-cup-roger-federer-rafael-nadal.html|access-date=2020-06-07|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Europe won the [[2017 Laver Cup|inaugural Laver Cup]] in 2017. Federer played his first singles match on day two, when he dispatched Sam Querrey in straight sets. Later on day two, he partnered with his rival Nadal in doubles, where they defeated the Team World duo of Sam Querrey and Jack Sock in the match tie breaker, which took place at one set all. This was the first time Federer and Nadal competed on the same side of a doubles match. On day three, Federer competed in the final match of the tournament, where he sealed victory for Team Europe by defeating Nick Kyrgios in the champion's tiebreak (saving a match point). With three wins and seven points, Federer was the most accomplished player of the tournament.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2017-09-24|title=Laver Cup 2017: Team Europe beat Team World 15-9 in inaugural competition|language=en-gb|work=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/41381665|access-date=2020-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Laver Cup 2017: Europe v The World - results & standings|language=en-gb|work=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/41326484|access-date=2020-06-07}}</ref>

The [[2018 Laver Cup|second edition]] was played in 2018. The European team led by Federer retained the title after defeating Team World, 13–8. Federer won both his singles matches, against Nick Kyrgios and John Isner, but lost both his doubles matches.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2018-09-24|title=Laver Cup: Roger Federer and Alexander Zverev win as Team Europe retain title|language=en-gb|work=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/45623805|access-date=2020-06-07}}</ref>

In 2019 the ATP announced that the Laver Cup would be an official event on the [[ATP Tour]], with match wins and losses to be counted as official on every player's career record in singles and doubles.

The [[2019 Laver Cup|third edition]] was held in Geneva, Switzerland. Federer and the European team captured their third consecutive title. Team World was closer than ever to win their first title, losing 11–13 after having led during the final day. Like in 2018, Federer won singles matches against Kyrgios and Isner. He went 1–1 in doubles.

Federer and Djokovic first played in a Grand Slam final at the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|2007 US Open]] where the three-time reigning champion and No. 1 Federer emerged victorious in straight sets.

Federer and [[Lleyton Hewitt]] played 27 times, with Federer leading 18–9.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roger Federer VS Lleyton Hewitt|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/roger-federer-vs-lleyton-hewitt/F324/H432|publisher=ATP World Tour|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref> Early in their careers, Hewitt dominated Federer, winning seven of their first nine meetings, including a victory from two sets down in the 2003 Davis Cup semifinal which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland. This marked a turning point in the rivalry, as Federer won 16 of the next 18 meetings from 2004 onwards. This is Hewitt's longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996. They met in one Grand Slam tournament final, the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|2004 US Open]] final, where Federer won his first US Open title in a lopsided encounter in which Federer scored a bagel on both sides of a second-set tiebreak. Federer met Hewitt at six of the Grand Slam tournaments in which he lifted the trophy, including all five of his triumphs between 2004 and 2005. Their last meeting was at the [[2014 Brisbane International]], where Hewitt triumphed over Federer in three sets for his first title since 2010, when he also beat Federer to the [[2010 Gerry Weber Open|Halle]] title.

Hewitt and Federer teamed up in the men's doubles at Wimbledon in [[1999 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Doubles|1999]]. They lost in the third round to [[Jonas Björkman]] and [[Pat Rafter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-28/federer-praises-hewitt-on-the-eve-of-his-final-wimbledon/6578372|title=Wimbledon: Lleyton Hewitt praised by Roger Federer ahead of SW19 finale|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=27 June 2015 |accessdate=8 July 2016}}</ref>

Wawrinka defeated Federer in straight sets during the [[2015 French Open – Men's Singles|2015 French Open]] quarterfinals en route to winning his first French Open title, although Federer then won a straight-sets victory in the [[2015 US Open – Men's Singles|2015 US Open]] semifinals.

In the 2017 U.S. Open quarterfinals, in a rematch of the 2009 US Open final, Del Potro again beat Federer in four sets to end his unbeaten streak in grand slams that year. With this win, Del Potro also denied the first Federer-Nadal match at US Open, as in 2009 where he beat Nadal in straight sets in the semifinals. Federer, however avenged this loss at the Shanghai Masters semifinals, where he beat del Potro in three sets after coming from a set down. In the final at the [[2018 BNP Paribas Open]] del Potro beat Federer in three close sets, after facing match points in the third set.

During this period rising revenues led to exploding prize money; when Federer first won the [[Australian Open]] in 2004 he earned $985,000, compared to when he won in 2018 and the prize had increased to AUD 4{{nbsp}}million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/roger-federer/f324/overview|title=Roger Federer – Player Activity – ATP World Tour – Tennis|website=ATP World Tour}}</ref>

==Playing style==
Federer's versatility has been described by [[Jimmy Connors]]: "In an era of specialists, you're either a clay court specialist, a grass court specialist, or a hard court specialist... or you're Roger Federer."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsfeelgoodstories.com/2009/02/20/roger-federer-a-class-act-on-and-off-the-court-leads-tennis-revival/|title=Roger Federer, a class act on and off the court, leads tennis revival|author=sportsfeelgoodstories.com|date=20 February 2009|accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref>

[[Dominik Hrbaty]] described what it was like to play Federer in the Scoop Malinowski book ''Facing Federer'': "Roger is different. He's the new generation. He was comparable to [[Marcelo Rios]], very talented, he has great hands, but the difference was Roger had the big serve, big return. He could make winners out of anything basically. And even out of defense. And Roger is just one of a kind." <ref>https://www.tennisfrontier.com/news/atp-tennis/facing-federer-dominik-hrbatys-take/</ref>

[[File:The Federer Technique - Oz Open 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Federer serving at the [[Australian Open]] in 2014]]
An elite athlete, Federer is an [[Tennis strategy#All-court player|all-court, all-around player]] known for his speed, fluid style of play, and exceptional shot making. Federer mainly plays from the baseline but is also comfortable at the net, being one of the best volleyers in the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/696033/sizzling-on-court-humble-off-court/|title=Hall of Fame: Roger Federer – the Swiss Maestro|first=Aamna |last=Saiyid |work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref> He has a powerful, accurate [[smash (tennis)|smash]] and very effectively performs rare elements of professional tennis, such as the backhand smash and [[skyhook (tennis)|skyhook]], half-volley, jump smash (slam dunk) and an aggressive serve return known affectionately as SABR (Sneak Attack By Roger, a half-volley attack on an opponent's second serve). [[David Foster Wallace]] compared the brute force of Federer's forehand motion with that of "a great liquid whip",<ref name="Wallace">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html|author=David Foster Wallace|title=Roger Federer as Religious Experience|date=20 August 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2 February 2018|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> while [[John McEnroe]] has referred to Federer's forehand as "the greatest shot in our sport."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/roger-or-rafa-clash-of-the-wimbledon-sex-symbols-860499.html|title=Roger or Rafa: Clash of the Wimbledon sex symbols|work=The Independent|date=5 July 2008|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> Federer is also known for his efficient, deceptively effortless movement around the court and excellent footwork, which enables him to run around shots directed to his backhand, usually considered his weaker wing, and instead hit a powerful and penetrating inside-out or inside-in forehand, one of his best shots. He also has great variety with his forehand, able to hit with topspin or pace (or both), thus opening up the court and going in to the forecourt for aggressive volleys.

Federer plays with a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the [[Backspin|slice]], occasionally using it to lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire [[topspin]] winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net.<ref name="Wallace"/> He has averaged 90% of service games won throughout his career, oftentimes coming up victorious in clutch or pressure service games. His [[serve (tennis)|serve]] is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve he is going to hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200{{nbsp}}km/h (125{{nbsp}}mph);<ref name=AUSServe>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/scores/stats/day19/1701ms.html |title=Match Statistics: Federer vs. Murray |author=Australianopen.com |accessdate=16 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225093113/http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/scores/stats/day19/1701ms.html |archivedate=25 February 2010 }}</ref><ref name=WIMBYServe>{{cite web|url=http://2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day21/1701ms.html|title=Match Statistics:Federer vs. Roddick|author=Wimbledon.org|accessdate=16 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612031302/http://2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day21/1701ms.html|archivedate=12 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon08/columns/story?columnist=ubha_ravi&id=3471097|title=Federer's serve allowing him to manufacture easy points|first=Ravi |last=Ubha |publisher=ESPN|date=2 July 2008|accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref> however, he is capable of serving at 220{{nbsp}}km/h (137{{nbsp}}mph).<ref name=AUSServe/><ref name=WIMBYServe/> Federer is also accomplished at [[serve and volley]]ing,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/jul/08/tennis.wimbledon2003|first=Stephen |last=Bierley |title=Serve-volley dead?

Later in his career, Federer added the drop shot to his arsenal and can perform a well-disguised one off both wings. He sometimes uses a between-the-legs shot, which is colloquially referred to as a "[[Tweener (tennis)|tweener]]" or "hotdog". His most notable use of the tweener was in the semifinals of the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]] against [[Novak Djokovic]], bringing him triple match point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/264126-the-tail-of-two-tweeners-federer-vs-llodra|title=The Tale of Two Tweeners: Federer vs. Llodra|first=Nima |last=Naderi |publisher=bleacherreport.com|date=30 September 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207163358/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/264126-the-tail-of-two-tweeners-federer-vs-llodra|archivedate=7 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Federer is one of the top players who employ successfully the "squash shot", when he gets pushed deep and wide on his forehand wing. Since [[Stefan Edberg]] joined his coaching team at the start of the 2014 season, Federer has played a more offensive game, attacking the net more often, and improved his volley shots.<ref>{{cite web|first=Steve |last=Tignor|title=No. 8: The Roger Resurgence|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/12/roger-resurgence/53370/|publisher=Tennis.com|date=3 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Peter |last=Bodo|title=The Reliables|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/08/reliables/52464|publisher=Tennis.com|date=17 August 2014|authorlink1=Peter Bodo}}</ref> In the lead-up to the 2015 US Open, Federer successfully added a new unique shot to his arsenal called SABR (Sneak Attack by Roger), in which he charges forward to receive the second serve and hits a return on the service line. The SABR is a unique shot that Federer owns, in the way that he manages to add enough power and placement into the shot, which makes it very difficult, or close to impossible for the opponent to reach it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2015-09-03/the_sabr_federers_new_bravado.html?chip=2|title=The SABR: Federer's new bravado|website=USOpen.org}}</ref>
With the switch to a bigger 97 inch racket from 90 inches, Federer has gained easy power while relinquishing some control on his shots. The bigger racket has enabled easier serving and better defense on both wings with fewer shanks. However this has diminished control and power on his forehand, slice backhand and dropshot.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kamashi |last=Tandon|title=Roger Federer Credits Switch To Bigger Racquet For Improved Backhand|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2017/03/roger-federer-racquet-change-backhand-rafael-nadal-indian-wells/64840/|publisher=Tennis.com|date=16 March 2017|accessdate=25 June 2019}}</ref> Since his comeback in 2017, Federer is noted for his improved backhand both down the line and cross court which was cited as the reason for his win against Nadal in the 2017 Australian Open Final and Indian Wells 4th round.

Federer is also noted for his cool demeanour and emotional control on the court. In contrast to his early career, most of his professional game has been characterised by lack of outbursts or emotional frustration at errors, which gives him an advantage over less controlled opponents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/addiction-in-society/201509/why-roger-federer-is-great|title=Why Roger Federer is Great|first=Stanton |last=Peele |publisher=psychologytoday.com|date=28 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/sports/tennis/10federer.html|title=Cool Federer Image Was Forged in a Hot Head|first=David |last=Waldstein |work=The New York Times|date=28 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Roger_Federer/78128/roger-federer-i-do-not-know-if-i-will-be-playing-in-three-or-five-years-/|title=Roger Federer: 'I do not know if I will be playing in three or five years'|website=Tennis World USA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>

Federer declared:
{{bquote|I don't get the anxiety during a match so much anymore. You know, to throw racquets, to toss balls out of the court, scream and stuff.
