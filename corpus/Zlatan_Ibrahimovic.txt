Ibrahimović signed his first contract with Malmö in 1996, and moved up to the senior side for the 1999 season of [[Allsvenskan]], Sweden's top-flight league. That season, Malmö finished 13th in the league and were relegated to the second division, but returned to the top flight the next season.

Ibrahimović received little playing time under manager [[Co Adriaanse]], but when Adriaanse was sacked on 29 November 2001, new coach [[Ronald Koeman]] inserted Ibrahimović into the starting lineup as Ajax won the 2001–02 Eredivisie title. The next season, Ibrahimović scored twice in a 2–1 victory over French champions [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in his [[2002–03 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] debut on 17 September 2002.

Ibrahimović's profile rose when he scored an individual goal against [[NAC Breda]] on 22 August 2004 – a slaloming run past five opposition players which the commentator compared with [[Diego Maradona]] and [[Zinedine Zidane]] – that was eventually voted the Goal of the Year by [[Eurosport]] viewers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Goal • Zlatan Ibrahimović • Ajax – NAC Breda (22-08-2004) |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pISL8A1FfG8 |via=YouTube |publisher=Ajax • Eredivisie Archief|accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref><ref name="zlatanibrahimovic.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.zlatanibrahimovic.net/career/|title=Zlatans Career|publisher=ZlatanIbrahimovic.net|accessdate=7 December 2008}}</ref> On 18 August 2004, during an international match against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], Ibrahimović injured Ajax teammate [[Rafael van der Vaart]], who later accused Ibrahimović of hurting him intentionally.<ref>{{cite news |first=Utsav |last=Agarwal |title=10 Zlatan Ibrahimovic controversies that shocked the world |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/10-zlatan-ibrahimovic-controversies-shocked-world |website=sportskeeda.com |date=9 June 2016 |accessdate=7 May 2020 }}</ref>

The following season was poor compared to his first season; his role in Juventus' attack changed, as he became less of a goalscorer and moved more to the sidelines, taking much part in the build-up play, especially as a target player, and his [[Assist (football)|assist]] numbers increased. In the 2005–06 season, Juventus fans often got frustrated with him due to his anonymous presence in certain important games such as the Champions League defeat to Arsenal. Juventus were stripped of their last two ''[[Scudetto|Scudetti]]'' as part of the verdict from the ''[[2006 Italian football scandal|Calciopoli scandal]]'', and were relegated to [[Serie B]]. The new staff tried to persuade Ibrahimović and other top players to stay with Juventus, but the player and his agent were adamant to move on, with Raiola threatening legal action in order to extricate Ibrahimović from his contract.<ref name="The Independent">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/ibrahimovic-set-to-take-legal-action-to-escape-from-juve-410436.html|title=Ibrahimovic set to take legal action to escape from Juve|work=The Independent|first=John|last=Nisbet|date=3 August 2006|accessdate=7 December 2008}}</ref>

===Euro 2008 and 2010 World Cup qualifying===
Ibrahimović was called up for a [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group F|qualifier]] against [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]] on 6 September 2006, but two days before the match, he violated team [[curfew]] by leaving the hotel with teammates [[Christian Wilhelmsson]] and [[Olof Mellberg]], visiting a [[nightclub]]. Though none of the players consumed any alcohol, they were nonetheless all sent home by manager [[Lars Lagerbäck]] as punishment and did not take part in the match. Mellberg and Wilhelmsson did not appeal the coach's decision, but Ibrahimović felt that it was unjust and therefore refused to take part in Sweden's next qualifiers against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. He also refused to partake in a friendly against [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] on 7 February 2007, but ended his self-imposed [[boycott]] a month later,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/411884|title=Ibrahimovic agrees to return to Sweden side|publisher=ESPN FC|accessdate=2 March 2007}}</ref> and returned for Sweden's loss to [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] on 28 March.

Ibrahimović has been involved in several violent incidents with teammates.

Ibrahimović has additionally engaged in multiple incidents while with the national team.

In 2013, he came under fire from the [[Sweden women's national football team|Sweden women's national team]] for an interview published on Christmas Day by tabloid ''[[Expressen]]'', in which he had commented about the disparity of achievements by, and the treatment of, male and female footballers. His former teammate [[Anders Svensson (footballer, born 1976)|Anders Svensson]] had been rewarded with a car for becoming Sweden's most-[[Cap (sport)|capped]] player that year, but [[Therese Sjögran]] had received no such reward for doing likewise for the women's team, despite owning 41 more caps (187 to 146) than Svensson at the time.<ref name="radio"/> Ibrahimović's response to the issue was that Sweden would be "devaluing" Svensson "by comparing him with the ladies' individual achievements.

Ibrahimović was born to a [[Bosniak]] [[Muslim]] father, Šefik Ibrahimović, and a [[Croat]] [[Catholic]] mother, Jurka Gravić; his parents were immigrants to Sweden from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], Šefik from [[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and Jurka from [[SR Croatia]], and met for the first time in Sweden. Ibrahimović's parents divorced when he was a child, and although his upbringing was divided between them, he spent more time with his father: "I had time with my mother but I really lived with my father."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/06/zlatan-ibrahimovic-trash-talking-sweden-record-golascorer|title=Zlatan Ibrahimovic: 'Everybody was trash-talking me.

The Malmö-based television presenter Teddy Landén, who was interviewed for the same documentary, noted Ibrahimović's choice of shirt name following his 2001 transfer to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]: "You can see that just the fact that when he [emerged] in the professional [football] world [at Ajax], from Sweden, where he was only known [by the name] Zlatan – his first name – he changed so he would have Ibrahimović on his shirt, on his jersey, because he wanted to honour his background. Being from a Muslim background, being from a very very low key, very low status background, he really [wanted] to show all the kids from [[Rosengård]] [and] from Malmö in general: 'If I can do it, you can do it.'"<ref>6 January 2014, ''Who Is Zlatan Ibrahimović?'', beIN SPORTS, 7:45–8:20</ref>

===Body art===
His surname is tattooed in Arabic on the back of his right arm, the names of his sons Vincent and Maximilian on his right arm. He has the common Buddhist "Five Deva Faces Yantra" representing wind, water, fire, creative perception and space, arranged in a way believed to ward off illness and injury, on his lower back. Another Buddhist tattoo, a "Yant Prajao Khao Nirote" is a protective emblem intended to end the suffering of a family, is on his upper right arm. The phrase 'Only God can judge me' is tattooed on his ribcage. He also has a feather, a [[Koi fish]], Polynesian tribal, and ace of hearts and clubs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/15/zlatan-ibrahimovic-tattoos-world-famine|title=Zlatan Ibrahimovic: new tattoos were to draw attention to world famine|first=Associated|last=Press|date=15 February 2015|work=The Guardian}}</ref>
